**Mom’s pacing again.** Her heels strike the hardwood floor, cutting through the thick air of her office. Power radiates off her in waves—the kind of power I’ve spent my life trying to mimic. Everything about her posture demands attention, commands the room. She doesn’t even have to say anything, and I’m already folding into myself, waiting for whatever verdict she’s about to deliver.

*"I’m…proud of you, Anna."* Her voice broke the torturing silence, cutting through the tension. This is it. This is what I've been waiting for my entire life. She’s proud. And here it is—delivered right to me. She should be. God’s Might Ministries has grown under my leadership—I’ve poured everything into it. But something in her voice doesn’t sit right.
I nod. Everything is going perfectly. So why isn’t it landing? 

*"Thank you, Mom."* My voice is light, detached, but that shouldn't be possible. This should feel different. I should feel different.

Mom stops, turns to face me. That smileemdashshe flips it like a switch. Curved perfect, glowing, inviting, that *You can trust me with everything.* smile. She's not just beautiful like this, not to the people around her, she's invincible. She's in the zone. That smile is everything I've tried to be and more. That smileemdashthat smile isn't right.

And then…I see it. The smile doesn’t reach her eyes. 

I freeze. I’ve seen it before—on the stage, after sermons, shaking hands, holding court with the congregation. That same practiced expression, that calculated grin. It's never faltered, but right now, it feels out of place. I don’t know why, but I’m sure I’ve seen it somewhere else, somewhere specific. Something in my memory stirs, but the thought skates away before I can catch it. 

I stop too, look at her. I have to have seen that smile before a thousand times, between stage, sermon, handshake, and holding court with her congregation. Same expression, same calculated grin. Not *You can trust me with everything* but *You will trust me with everything because it's already mine.*.

*Where do I know that look from?*

*Why can’t I place it?*

A wave of cold comes over me suddenly. I've given everything to be in the moment. I've dreamt about this moment. I've fantasized about this moment during boring lectures for crying out loud. And here it is, right before me…and nothing.

*"You’ve done so well,"* she says, almost like she’s reminding herself. Her eyes skim over me like she’s assessing the results of a project, not talking to her daughter. My heart races. Why am I panicking? This is what I’ve been waiting for, isn’t it?

*"I’ve been thinking,"* she continues, her fingers tracing the edge of the desk, each movement deliberate, every gesture controlled. She’s perfect. Too perfect. *"You’ve proven yourself. I think it’s time we expand God’s Might Ministries."*


*"I mean, you’ve done a remarkable job with the youth ministry,"* she continues, her tone level, almost… distant. *"Our numbers are up, the children are engaged, and they’re spreading the word of God."* 

I could hear a but coming.

"But since we've come so far now, why not do more?" She asked rhetorically.
She finally stops, leaning against the desk, arms crossed. *"I’ve been thinking about ways we can expand God’s Might Ministries."* Her fingers tap idly on the wood as she talks, still not really looking at me. *"It’s not enough to just teach them scripture. We can do more than that now, we **should** do more than that. We should to prepare them, really prepare them."*
I frown. *"Prepare them?"* That doesn’t sound like something you’d do for a church youth group. What does she mean by that?
She nods, almost absentmindedly. *"Yes, yes. They’re young. They’re impressionable. They're just as easy to teach as they are to lead astray. If we lose them to some kind of street shaman…no, that can't happen. We need to be instilling not just faith, but discipline. Training them to be strong, unshakable. We should introduce more… structure."*
*"Structure?"* My voice wavers, and I force a smile, trying to keep up. *"We already have Bible study, group activities, and community outreach. The kids are—"*
She cuts me off, waving her hand dismissively. *"That’s fine, Anna, but it’s not enough."* She steps forward, that same practiced smile flickering back to life. *"These children need to be molded, shaped into the next generation of God’s army. They need to be ready to fight for their faith, to defend it against the evils of the world."*

She eyed me carefully, as if gauging my retention.

"Did you really think that after we've come this far, Satan would simply stand down? No, with how far we've come, Satan is going to up his ante. A war is coming. And I won't, I can't, let those children march into battle with less than a prayer." Julia said, now building momentum.

That was meant to be the beginning of the crescendo, I knew it, but all I could think about was that sending children into a battle with a prayer, knowing who would be receiving that prayer, was a lot more preparation than she realized it was.

My stomach tightens. Fight? Defend? What is she talking about? She's **never** talked like this before. *"But they’re… they’re kids, Mom. They’re just learning. Isn’t our goal to help them grow in their faith?"* 

Finally, she looks at me. The smile never falters, but her eyes… they’re too cold, too distant. Too…fanatical. *"Our goal, Anna, is to prepare them for what’s coming. This world is growing darker every day. The true believers, the ones who will stand by God, need to be ready for whatever comes next. If that means teaching them to fight, so be it."*

I blink, struggling to keep my face neutral. Fight? We’ve never talked about anything like that before. God’s Might Ministries is supposed to be a safe space for these kids, a place where they can learn about God’s love and grow in their faith. But this… this doesn’t make sense. *"I don’t understand,"* I say, my voice smaller than I want it to be. 

She sighs, the kind of sigh that says I’ve missed something obvious. *"Anna, you’re still thinking small. You’ve done well with the ministry, but this isn’t just about Sunday school lessons and community service. It’s about building a force. God’s army."* 

The words slam into me like a punch. God’s army? I’ve never heard her talk like this before. 

I stand there, frozen in place. *"You understand, don’t you, Anna?"* Mom’s voice sounds so confused, like I've failed to understand something very foundational. But everything inside me is tangled, tightening. I should just nod. Agree. That’s what she wants.

*"Yes, Mom."* The words are right there, sitting on my tongue, waiting to roll off. They’d smooth things over. Keep her happy, keep her proud. I’d go back to Troy, pass on what I’ve learned, and we’d come up with a plan. He’d help me. I’ve done this before. Played this game before. This wasn't my fight. There were people I could call that could deal with this far more effectively than I could.

Just say it.

But, of course, that isn't what Anna 'not her mother' Hawthorne said.

But something holds me back. Something… wrong.

*"But that’s not…"* I trail off, unsure how to even finish the thought. This is the woman I’ve spent my life trying to emulate, but what she’s saying—it doesn’t fit. It doesn’t belong. We’re not supposed to be building soldiers. We’re supposed to be guiding these kids in their faith, helping them become closer to God, not preparing them for war.

My chest tightens again, a different kind of tightness now. The weight of her words sinks deeper, twisting. Soldiers. Structure. Fighting for their faith. This isn’t what I signed up for. This isn’t what *they* signed up for.

This isn’t right.

I swallow, and my mouth feels dry, like no matter what I say, the words will crack and fall apart. I’ve worked so hard for this moment, finally proving myself to her, finally earning her approval. She’s *proud of me*. Isn’t that what I’ve wanted all along?

But it feels empty. Hollow. Like she’s praising someone I don’t even recognize. 

I can feel the moment slipping away, the perfect plan I’d imagined crumbling in my hands. Troy can’t fix this. No plan can. Not if I have to sit here and lie to myself, to these kids, to God. *I refuse to turn children into soldiers. That's not who I am.*

It feels like betrayal. Of everything I’ve believed. Everything I’ve worked for.

A question bubbled up in that thought's wake.

*Then who are you, Anna.*

And I realized I didn't know. But I knew it wasn't this.

*"Anna?"* Mom’s voice cuts through my thoughts again, sharp and expectant. She’s still watching me, waiting for me to nod, to agree, to tell her that I’ll lead these kids down the same twisted path she’s imagining. 

I want to. I want to make her proud. I want to be what she sees in me, the perfect daughter, the perfect leader. But I can’t. Not like this.

I force my eyes open, meeting hers, and the panic rises like a wave. She’s expecting me to agree. Expecting me to *fall in line*. But that look in her eyes, that coldness—I can’t shake it. That smile still lingers in my mind, lurking just beneath the surface. The one that’s *not hers*.

Her eyes flicker, just for a moment, and that’s when I see it. That smile again, the one she wears when she’s putting on a show, the one she wears in front of the congregation. It’s too polished, too smooth. Something about it feels staged. And for the first time, I feel the cold realization creeping up my spine—she’s not even paying attention to me.

I swallow hard. *"Mom, the kids… they’re not soldiers. They’re just learning."*

*"Exactly,"* she says, too quickly, already moving on. *"They’re learning to become soldiers for God. That’s what this ministry is for, Anna. To train them, to harden their faith. To ensure they are ready for the war that's going to come. This isn’t just about Bible verses and good deeds anymore. The world is changing. We need to prepare them for that."*

She’s not hearing me. Not really. Her words are sliding over me, polished, perfect, but empty. She’s talking about expanding the ministry, about discipline, about turning a youth group into… into what? A militia?

My chest tightens, and my breath quickens. This is my ministry. I’ve worked so hard to make it a place where these kids feel safe, where they can learn and grow in their faith. And now, it feels like she’s ripping it out of my hands, twisting it into something unrecognizable.

But the worst part? I don’t know how to stop her.

*"I’ve already spoken with a few of the elders,"* she continues, as if this conversation is already over. *"They agree that we need to be doing more. We can bring in more structure, introduce new activities that challenge them, push them. They need to be prepared for what’s coming."*

The air feels thick, suffocating. I can’t breathe. This is wrong, all of it. But I can’t tell her that. Not without disappointing her, not without shattering the image I’ve spent years trying to live up to.

And then there’s that smile again. She’s looking at me now, her eyes scanning me like she’s evaluating a project, not talking to her daughter. The same smile I’ve seen a thousand times, in front of the congregation, after her sermons. But there’s something more, something underneath it—cold, calculating.

Where have I seen it before?

I nod again, but the panic is starting to set in. My breath catches in my throat, heart pounding against my ribs. This is the moment I’ve worked for, the culmination of everything I’ve been fighting to become—the perfect daughter, the leader, just like Mom. But all I feel is the cold absence of what I thought would be here.

Her eyes. The smile. It’s wrong. Something is wrong, and I can’t pinpoint it. Why does this feel so fake?  

*"We’ll talk more soon,"* she says, her voice like velvet. *"But for now, just keep doing what you’re doing."* 

*This is not a correction. This is a coup.*

I’ve seen it before. I’ve seen it in the eyes of the people I’m supposed to be leading. The way they smile when they’re pretending to believe. When they’re pretending to follow.

But now it's not little kids replying with a magic 8 ball of Jesus, God, Bible, and Holy Spirit. 

This is my mom. Staring back at me. Fully convinced. Giving me dogmatic answers and completely blocking out all reason. Forget getting Troy. Did I need a priest?

I can feel my pulse hammering in my ears, every beat screaming that I should say *yes*, keep up the act. But my throat closes up, my mouth dry as dust. My heart won’t let me. Something deep inside of me won't let this happen.

*"Mom, I…"* I start, the words catching in my throat. What am I even supposed to say? How do I explain something I barely understand? 

The silence between us thickens, and I can see her impatience growing. I need to say something. I need to fix this. But the lie I’ve been telling myself is already cracking, and I can’t make it fit anymore.

I can’t just agree.

*"I don’t think that’s what we should be doing,"* I say softly, the words barely escaping my lips. My heart races, and I don’t know if I’m terrified or relieved. 

The reaction is instantaneous, as if I've just told her the sky is red.

Mom’s brow furrows. *"What do you mean?"*

I glance away, unable to hold her gaze. The weight of it presses down on me, suffocating. *"The kids… they’re not soldiers, Mom. They’re not ready for that. And… I don’t think that’s what God wants."*

And in an instant, I see it. I'm not talking to a person anymore. I'm talking to a patchwork of dogmatic phrases strung together to justify something darker.

"I suppose God made you His prophet? His arbiter of His Will?" She accused, wheeling on me.

"No, but-" I blurted.

"I did not come this far to be called a heretic, Anna." My mother glared at me.

"Wrong? Anna, this is the path God has laid out for us. For you. These children need to be prepared for the battle ahead."*

*"But that’s not what we’re here to do,"* I argue, surprising myself with the strength in my voice. *"We’re supposed to be helping them grow in their faith, not turning them into soldiers. That’s not what this ministry is about."*

And then she locked eyes with me. All I could see in her eyes was fury.

"This ministry is about what *I say* it is about, Anna. I gave you a chance to make your mark. You've made it. You've definitely proven yourself many times over. But if you are going to go behind my back and say I don't have a clue what I'm doing, maybe get a second opinion first. Or get a sign. Because high-minded ideals are not going to save those children, Anna. What they need, and you listen to me very carefully now, is action."

Her voice rose to a shout.

"You want to rip out *my* church from under me! Do you? Then you can dig up Toby and get him to tell me what I'm doing wrong because I am *NOT* going to stand here and let my daughter call me an idiot!"

You could've heard a pin drop in the silence that followed. My own mom had screamed at me. She could tell I was scared of her right now.

The words come out before I can stop them. "If I really dug him up, I might see he didn’t die of a heart attack."

I didn't know what I'd just done, but I could see that she was scared now. And right now, that was a good thing.

What followed was an immediate 180 from her.

She paused, smiling to attempt to reassure me.

"Now where were we? Oh, yes, of course. We'll be making a few adjustments to your program, like I told you before. Nothing you need to worry about. You can just keep doing what you're doing and we'll handle everything for you." She said, back to calm and collected in a matter of seconds.

"But-" I blurted, only mere moments from the dam breaking.

I glance at Mom, expecting her to say something, to push me further, to snap me out of this fog. But she’s already moved on, already plotting. She’s talking again, her words barely making sense to me, like static buzzing in the background.

*"But what? If you have issues with this arrangement, then please, speak. We can talk this out. But if you object to the concept entirely...well...you’re not going to lead them properly, Anna, I’ll have to make some adjustments. We’ll make them into something stronger. I’ll take over—just temporarily—until you can see the bigger picture."* 

My head snaps up. *"Wait, what?"*

She’s not even looking at me. She’s pacing now, her hands gesturing as if she’s already giving commands to people who aren’t here. She’s talking fast, her words sharper, more insistent. *"You’re too focused on what’s right in front of you, Anna. This is about the future. About *our* future. God has shown me the way forward, and we need to act. You’ll thank me later."*

I blink, trying to catch up, but her words blur together, like a wave crashing over me. *Thank her?* Is she serious?

*"No, wait—"*

She stops, finally looking at me, but there’s a distance in her eyes I don’t recognize. It’s like she’s already decided what needs to happen, like I’m not even part of the equation anymore. This conversation is nothing more than a formality at this point.

*"Don't worry. You’re still learning, Anna. You’ll get there. But for now, let me take care of things."* Her voice is calm, almost patronizing. And that smile—that smile that doesn’t belong to her—flickers back into place.

A cold shiver runs down my spine.

*"What about me?"* I manage, though my voice sounds small, far away. *"I’m supposed to be in charge of this. This is *my* ministry, my—"*

*"Oh, it’s still yours, dear."* Her smile widens, but it’s empty, like she’s not really hearing me. *"I’m just stepping in to help. To make sure everything stays on course."*

It doesn’t feel like help. It feels like she’s taking over. 

Because this isn’t just about me anymore. This is about *her*. Her vision. Her path. And for the first time, I realize how small I am in her world. How little my faith—my beliefs—really matter to her.

She’s building something bigger, something *different*.

Something I don’t recognize.

*"You’ll see, Anna. God is teaching us both a lesson here. He’s shown me the way forward, and you… you’re just starting to see it."* Her voice lowers, like she’s letting me in on a secret. But it feels like she’s speaking to herself, like she’s not even aware of what she’s saying.

And for the first time, I see it. The cracks. The tiny fractures in her perfect composure. The delusions creeping in. She’s falling for her own story. She’s convinced this is all part of some divine plan. 

And that terrifies me.

And that’s the breaking point. Tears spring to my eyes before I can stop them. My throat closes up, and everything inside me starts to collapse. She’s tearing me apart, and there’s nothing I can say or do to fix this. Nothing I do is enough. I feel the words choke in my throat, but they don’t come out. Instead, I start sobbing.

"Oh, don’t cry now, Anna." She said, with a voice so delicate and precise you could do open heart surgery with it. "Everything is going to be okay. You'll keep everything of importance. This is a semantic adjustment, nothing more."

"Where's that fiery girl that told me I didn't know what I was doing? Where'd she go?" She asked playfully. "Chin up. You'll survive this. In fact, if you play your cards right, you may even thrive."

And then, something inside me snaps. It's not loud. It's not violent. But it’s there—a flicker of something sharp and cold, something that’s been buried so deep, I almost didn’t know it existed.

"What's *really* happening here?" I asked, my skepticism suddenly burning out of me.

"Excuse me?" She asks, sounding a mixture of confused and offended.

"You heard me. This isn't just some small correction, is it? This is a coup. You're going over my head to make the changes that I refuse to make, aren't you?" I asked. 

"Anna, don't get ahead of yourself. I would never. I can tell you're upset, that this ministry really matters to you. I promise you, I'm not going to get in your way. Really. You won't even notice the changes I'll make." She assured me.

I wasn't having it. 

"And if I do notice the changes you make? If I don't like them?" I asked. 

"We will cross that bridge if we come to it, and only then." She said. 

Over the months, I'd pieced together a lot on my own. A lot of the internal conflict of the church. A lot of the conflict within the underworld. At the end of the day, all I had was hunches. 

But if I was right, then I was about to know for certain.

"Like Toby did?" I asked.

"Do not drag that poor man into this conversation." She said. 

I read her face. For less than a second, though it was definitely there, I saw shock. And a bit of fear. So she *did* know something, then. Puzzle pieces began clicking together.

"Why so defensive?" I asked. 

I had been at the other end of this bag of tricks for fourteen years. I had the right to use it just once.

"I'm not defensive. I'm stunned that you would use a dead man as a token in an argument." She said, defensively.

"I'm not mad," I said softly, giving her a gentle smile. "I don't blame you for being angry either. I just want to know what happened between you and Toby."

She stiffened immediately. Troy had taught me this, but even before he'd said anything, I'd known about it. You get to tactics like these really well when they are used on you time after time after time.

*Lower the barriers to entry. Remove the guilt. Make it easier to be vulnerable.*

"Help me understand. I don't want to think that you did anything wrong, so please. What happened?" I asked softly. I frowned, looking empathetic, and held her eyes.


It lasted for less than a second, but I saw it. Fear. It flashed in her eyes before she covered it up, but I knew what I saw. And for the first time in the entire conversation, she looked at me like I'd genuinely caught her off guard. For a second, I felt powerful. I felt like I’ve just hit back in a way that matters.

But it’s gone just as quickly as it came. My control shatters, and I’m back to sobbing.

I don’t know what I’ve just said. I don’t know what it means. But she does.

And she’s afraid.

She backpedaled.

She stepped forward, her voice smooth. "Anna, I'm…I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to raise my voice. We’ve both been under so much pressure lately, and the stress has made both of us a wreck, it just slipped out before I could stop it."

I feel the heat rising in my chest, the urge to scream bubbling up like something uncontrollable. But she just keeps talking, like it’s going to fix anything.

“I shouldn’t have yelled at you," she says, all calm now, like she's trying to put out a fire she started. “You’ve always been such a good girl, always wanting to do the right thing. But you have to understand—”

“Stop it.”

The word cuts through the room, sharp and louder than I meant it to be. Her face freezes mid-sentence, caught between a smile and… something else. Something darker.

“Just stop, Mom.” My voice is shaking, but I don’t care. “I know what you’re doing, and I’m not falling for it. Not again. I'm not doing this again. Any of this.”

Her mouth opens slightly, but I don’t let her get a word in.

“This isn’t about me being a ‘good girl,’ okay? This is about you—always twisting everything so it fits into whatever you say the church needs. Never a rule you won't break to do what you need to do. Well you know what, I'm tired of it!” My heart is pounding, but I keep going. “I’m not going to sit here and let you talk me in circles just so you can keep covering up whatever it is you’ve done.”

The words hang between us, and for once, it’s not her controlling the conversation. It’s me.

"Now, pay attention, and you listen to me very carefully, because I'm only going to say this once. What happened to Tobias Anders?"

For a moment, she just stares at me, the smooth mask slipping ever so slightly. I can see the calculation in her eyes. She's trying to find her next move, trying to find the angle she can use to get me back under control. But she’s not fast enough. Not this time.

"Well?" I asked.

She stopped.

"Toby…didn't die of a heart attack." She said. 

My heart nearly stopped in my chest.

*What?*

"Toby…was poisoned. I was the one…who found the body." Julia said, her voice finally reduced to a whisper. "The poison was designed to mimic the symptoms of a heart attack. I only found out afterwards."

"Why lie about it?" I asked. 

"I didn't lie about it, Anna. I only found out it wasn't a heart attack *after* I told my entire congregation it was one." She explained. "I don't know who did it, or why, but I have a few ideas, and they aren't…pleasant."

I glance at Mom, expecting her to say something, to push me further, to snap me out of this fog. But she’s already moved on, already plotting. She’s talking again, her words barely making sense to me, like static buzzing in the background.

*"If you’re not going to lead them properly, Anna, I’ll have to make some adjustments. We’ll make them into something stronger. I’ll take over—just temporarily—until you can see the bigger picture."* 

My head snaps up. *"Wait, what?"*

She’s not even looking at me. She’s pacing now, her hands gesturing as if she’s already giving commands to people who aren’t here. She’s talking fast, her words sharper, more insistent. *"You’re too focused on what’s right in front of you, Anna. This is about the future. About *our* future. God has shown me the way forward, and we need to act. You’ll thank me later."*

I blink, trying to catch up, but her words blur together, like a wave crashing over me. *Thank her?* Is she serious?

*"No, wait—"*

She stops, finally looking at me, but there’s a distance in her eyes I don’t recognize. It’s like she’s already decided what needs to happen, like I’m not even part of the equation anymore.

*"You’re still learning, Anna. You’ll get there. But for now, let me take care of things."* Her voice is calm, almost patronizing. And that smile—that smile that doesn’t belong to her—flickers back into place.

A cold shiver runs down my spine.

*"What about me?"* I manage, though my voice sounds small, far away. *"I’m supposed to be in charge of this. This is *my* ministry, my—"*

*"Oh, it’s still yours, dear."* Her smile widens, but it’s empty, like she’s not really hearing me. *"I’m just stepping in to help. To make sure everything stays on course."*

It doesn’t feel like help. It feels like she’s taking over. 

The panic rises again, sharp and suffocating. I should be fighting this, standing my ground, but I can’t shake the feeling that she’s already won. That no matter what I say, she’s already made her decision.

Because this isn’t just about me anymore. This is about *her*. Her vision. Her path. And for the first time, I realize how small I am in her world. How little my faith—my beliefs—really matter to her.

She’s building something bigger, something *different*.

Something I don’t recognize.

*"You’ll see, Anna. God is teaching us both a lesson here. He’s shown me the way forward, and you… you’re just starting to see it."* Her voice lowers, like she’s letting me in on a secret. But it feels like she’s speaking to herself, like she’s not even aware of what she’s saying.

And for the first time, I see it. The cracks. The tiny fractures in her perfect composure. The delusions creeping in. She’s falling for her own story. She’s convinced this is all part of some divine plan. 

And that terrifies me.

I can’t breathe. My heart pounds in my chest, and I can feel the ground slipping out from under me. Everything I’ve built, everything I thought I knew, is crumbling.

*"Mom—"*

But she’s already gone, back to pacing, back to planning. Back to building something I don’t understand.

And I’m left standing there, in the middle of it all, with nothing but this hollow feeling in my chest.

I’ve disappointed her. And I don’t even care.

I’ve made her proud. And it didn’t matter.

Something has changed.

And I have no idea what to do next.
