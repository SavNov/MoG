I step into the church basement, the scent of old wood and incense instantly familiar and comforting. A group of guys from the youth group catches my eye, their voices blending with the soft hum of conversation. Among them, a stranger stands out, his gestures confident, his presence magnetic.

I try to slip by unnoticed, but Auri spots me and waves me over eagerly. "Anna, come join us!" he calls out, his voice warm and inviting.

I approach hesitantly, offering a shy smile as I settle next to Auri. He introduces the stranger as Troy, and I nod politely, my curiosity piqued despite my nerves.

"Hi," I manage to say softly, meeting Troy's steady gaze.

"Nice to meet you, Anna," Troy replies calmly. "Are you a regular here?"

"Yeah," I say, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. "My mom, Julia Hawthorne, she's pretty involved."

Troy's eyebrows raise slightly, a flicker of recognition crossing his face. "Julia Hawthorne," he muses. "She must do a lot around here."

I nod, a knot forming in my stomach. "Yeah, she's... she's always busy."

Troy leans in, his voice gentle yet probing. "What exactly does your mother do here?"

I hesitate, unsure how much to reveal. "She leads ministries, plans events... She's a big part of everything."

Troy nods, absorbing my words. "Sounds like she carries a lot of responsibility."

"Yeah," I admit with a nervous laugh. "Sometimes it feels like it's all too much."

His understanding expression offers me a moment of relief. "Do you help out with the ministries?"

I shake my head, feeling a pang of guilt. "Not really. I try to, but... it's complicated."

Troy listens attentively, asking about the church's activities and community involvement. His questions make me feel strangely validated, as if someone finally gets what I've been going through.

As we talk, I'm sharing more than I meant to, recounting stories of my struggles and moments of uncertainty within the church community.

The group eventually disperses, and I make a quick excuse to leave, seeking solace upstairs where the air feels lighter.

Stepping outside into the cool evening air, I can't shake the feeling that meeting Troy was more than chance. There's just something about him I can't quite place, and it keeps eating away at me.
