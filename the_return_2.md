You never, ever, expect it to happen to you. At least, not twice.

I'd been kidnapped before, yes, but I'd been an innocent little girl back then who still believed that there were good guys and bad guys and a few people in between. That, like in the movies, you got roughed up a little bit, then the scruffy action hero saved you. The police came. Something like that. 

Now it was people I knew were killers. People I'd spent months now looking at the bodies of, refusing to believe it. People who called themselves Christians, making a mockery of everything they claimed to stand for.

Now it was real. And now I knew the police weren't coming. If they knew where I was going to, the Might of God would've been taken down months ago. The FBI was drawing a total blank. Normal tactics weren't working. Building trust, mutual cooperation, none of it was making a dent. And people were still dying.

As I crawled out of the garbage bag, disoriented,  I saw that the room was dark. Not some kind of basement dark, but utterly pitch-black to the point that I couldn't even see my own hands. They hadn't bothered to tie my wrists. Even if I did get past my captors, where would I even go?

And in that moment, I finally, *finally* internalized something my mind had been rejecting ever since I'd gone to sleep after drinking that cup of coke months ago. That possibility, and now the certainty.

**I am going to die here.**

My hands were shaking. My whole body was sweating, and not just because I'd been stuffed in a garbage bag. My hair already felt wet, now reduced to a mop clinging to my head like a terrified badger. To say my clothes were tattered would've been an understatement. They had enough holes in them to make a block of swiss cheese blush. And then there was the smell. 

The smell of the room was completely overpowering. The stench of death, and blood, and bodies. It wasn't what I'd imagined those pictures to smell like, it was about a thousand times worse, and about a thousand times more intense. It took me every fiber of my being not to vomit, and the only reason I saw a point in holding it back was because I didn't think adding vomit to the smell would help my poor nostrils.

*Maybe I can convince them this was all some big mistake. That I was manipulated and lied to, or maybe that I was held under duress the whole time. Maybe that would work.*

I crawled out on my hands and knees, because I couldn't tell where the bag ended and the floor began in the darkness. And then I touched wet. And sticky. 

I leaned down very carefully, and sniffed. Blood. Fresh. 

I nearly vomited again. My fingers pushed forward. They hit something soft and flesh-

*Oh god…*

Skin. Drenched in blood, like the person it belonged to. Had belonged to. The moment my fingers crawled over the chest, it-

*Huh?*

-simply ended. Right there. I felt forward…

And that is when I vomited my guts out right into the dead body I was crawling over. Or at least, what was left of it.
