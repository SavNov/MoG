*Writer's notes, not part of draft:*
*This is the moment where her identities have completely collapsed. She has no idea who she is or what she stands for. Which rules to follow. And she. Is. Terrified.*

*She isn't the perfect daughter anymore. She isn't the perfect criminal anymore. She isn't the perfect Christian anymore. A boy ran away from her. And now all her attempts to cling onto and mold herself into these fractured identities have failed, and all the repercussions have rolled into one colossal ball of crap. One that's about to run her over.*

*This is about something else, too. This scene ties in everything she's learned, or failed to learn, because this is a culmination of her past failings. Within this, she sees the failings of everyone she's met so far, and is forced to reflect on her own.*

*She doesn't know who she is anymore. But oh boy, is there a part of her that does.*

# Begin
Today was the day 14 years of my life finally shattered into a hundred pieces. I didn't even know who I was anymore. Julia's daughter? A criminal? A Christian? To some, it was six in one and half a dozen the other. I didn't know enough to refute them. Maybe everything I'd ever believed was a lie. I simply didn't know anymore.

And now I'd been kidnapped.

I'd been kidnapped before, yes, but back then I'd been an innocent little girl who still believed that there were the good guys and the bad guys. And the good guys always won, even if they got roughed up by the baddies a little bit, sometimes a lot bit. But nobody was going to win this. My saviors weren't coming.

After all, if they knew where I was being held, the Might of God would've been taken down months ago. The police were a wash, SWAT was pointless, nothing was working.

The FBI was drawing a total blank, too. Normal tactics weren't working. Building trust, mutual cooperation, none of it was making a dent. Hell, they'd been given permission to torture high-value targets a few weeks ago, the world had become that scared, and still nothing. You couldn't torture people who believed that their pain only purified them and that death would yield them their ultimate reward: Heaven. It simply didn't work. These were, in their own words, people with nothing to lose. And those were the most dangerous.

Now it was just me and a building full of monsters that I'd grown up with, watched most of their lives play out like sitcoms, and something even worse. The ministry I'd built was now almost certainly going to kill me.
# This embodies everything. The ministry she built through fractured identity is coming to kill her, because it digs into her worst fear. Being evil. This thing that is undeniably hers, is now twisted beyond recognition. AS she sees this gore, she recognizes it. This is her fault.

As I crawled out of the garbage bag I'd been stuffed in, my sweaty hands struggling to rip open the plastic, the first thing to hit me was the smell: blood, rot, and death. I squinted through watery eyes, expecting a brightly lit room, but instead I saw that the room was dark. Not single-light-bulb-basement Hollywood dark, but pitch-black. I couldn't even see my own hands. It was hot too. Really hot. It felt like I was in a furnace, yet there was no fire. Maybe it was the overwhelming stench of death, but I couldn't even smell smoke. 

I should've known that it was a trap. But I'd been too desperate to be the good girl I'd always been told to be at long last that I'd ignored the warning signs and marched right into danger anyway. This was my fault.

Now that I moved my hands properly after freeing myself, I realized it in hindsight. They hadn't bothered to tie my wrists, and it disgusted me that I knew why. Even if I did get past my captors, where would I even go? If this place was anywhere near a major city, it would've been found *ages* ago. I'd be recaptured before long.

I could already see it. Breaking out of here, or lying my way out of here, or maybe even pulling rank, only to stare at— *Midwestern fields? Siberian tundra? Appalachian Mountains?* —and realize there was nowhere to escape **to**.

Or could I even lie my way out of here? I didn't know who I was, so maybe lying simply wasn't within my skill set.

And in that moment, I finally, *finally* internalized something my mind had been rejecting ever since I'd gone to sleep after drinking that spiked cup of coke months ago. That possibility, and now the certainty.

**I am going to die here.**
**All of this is my fault.**

I heard voices coming from the other room, wherever that was. Not deep voices. Young voices.

*No no nononono…*

"C'mon…it'll be fun! A little purity ritual for a Corrupted!" A younger boy called, and I could hear him through the thin walls of the room.

*I know that voice…Colin? And…what's a Corrupted?*

I knew my fair share of 'Hawthorne' speak. And Corrupted wasn't part of it. Then my mind zero-ed in on the words 'purity ritual' and I got scared instead of confused.

Was that what I'd been seeing for months now? The results of whatever this 'purity ritual' thing was? Was that what the victims were called? Corrupted? And was that before or after they died? I didn't have any answers, only questions.

"I don't know…what if it doesn't work? I don't want to have to…" The other boy, Richie, trailed off.

I could see the boy in my mind's eye now: Blonde hair, blue eyes, with blue jean-colored overalls and track-pants. No older than 10.

My hands were shaking. My hair already felt wet, now reduced to a mop clinging to my head like a terrified badger, but the sweat was only making it worse. To say my clothes were tattered would've been an understatement. They had enough holes in them to make a block of Swiss cheese blush. And then there was the smell. 

It wasn't what I'd imagined those pictures to smell like, it was about a thousand times worse, and about a thousand times more intense. I stifled the urge to vomit only because it would add to it rather than drown it out. 

*Maybe I can convince them this was all some big mistake. That I was manipulated and lied to, or maybe that I was held under duress the whole time. Maybe that would work.*

I crawled out on my hands and knees, because I couldn't tell where the bag ended and the floor began in the darkness. And then I touched wet. And sticky. 

I leaned down very carefully, and sniffed. Blood. Fresh. 

I nearly vomited again. My fingers pushed forward. They hit something soft and flesh-

*Oh god…*

Skin. Drenched in blood, like the person it belonged to. Had belonged to. The moment my fingers crawled over the chest, it-

*Huh?*

-simply ended. Right there. I felt forward…

And that is when I vomited my guts out right into the dead body I was crawling over. Or at least, what was left of it.

The arms had been cut off. No, cut was the wrong word. Sawed off. The cut was rough from what I felt. 

All of it was horrible. I crawled away from the body, only to stumble upon another. And another. And another…

Suddenly the lights came on. I didn't close my eyes fast enough, and the overhead phosphorescent lights left impressions on my vision that lingered longer than they should have. Someone was coming in. I could hear it.

*Play your role, Anna. They don't know why you left. You're a scared little girl who just wants to go home to her mommy.*

I was too busy trying to avoid certain death to even think about my current identity crisis.

"H-hello?" I stuttered intentionally, sounding terrified. "Is anybody there?"

Stupid? Yes. But that was the role I was playing. Or maybe that was just me. Who knew anymore?

# The girl should interrupt the conversation. Or, no, wait. This whole thing relies on the horror of 'oh my god' she changed, when that's a bad thing. Both of these characters are in internal conflict. Anna is living through the worst night of her life, going through an identity crisis. All the while, dominoes are falling. Dominoes that mirror the greater dominoes that have been falling all over the course of her arc. She abandons all of her identities, and finally faces her fear, because she's staring at the perfect version of herself under the old rules. The perfect daughter. The perfect criminal. The perfect criminal. She's doing everything right, and it horrifies her. 
A metal door came creaking open with such a violent sound on its rusty hinges that I immediately covered my ears to block out the noise. 

"Wait…Anna?" A girl said. Then I realized I recognized the voice. 

"J-Jaz?" I whispered. 

I looked up hesitantly, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the light. 

Her long brown hair, always wild and chaotic, was now in a perfect braid at the back of her head, like what I'd seen Buddhists have in the movies. Her eyebrows were immaculately shaved, though the better word would've been carved.

She was in a perfectly tailored white Devout's robe, golden cross pendant hanging around her neck just so. There were red stains on it that I very firmly chose to believe were ketchup. My nose couldn't tell. There were so many corpses and so much blood in this room that one stained robe wouldn't have made a difference.

I knew that look now.

That signature combination of guilt and forced control and emotional suppression. She'd killed someone. Recently, too. I suddenly looked around at all the bodies around me in various states of maiming. 

*This is a killing room. This is why the people disappear and then get thrown back onto the street later. They get killed here. This is why no one ever got caught.*

And then another thought.

*Is Jessica here to kill me?*

"What are…you doing here?" She asked, genuinely confused. 

She seemed to realize a single hair on her head was sticking out, and immediately reached for a pair of scissors within her belt, cutting the relevant hair off.

*A group of MoG members kidnapped me and I woke up here a few minutes ago.*

No. 

*Julia brought me here to show me something.*

That wouldn't explain the dirt and grime though… 

And then an insidious thought crept into my mind, and I found myself with a good lie. 

"The boy who kidnapped me—he…he left me here for dead…" I said softly. 

"He…left you here? What, did he really think—did you say boy?" Jessica asked, suddenly shocked.

For one terrible moment, I convinced myself this is good old Jaz. Jaz the rebel. Eyes flitting up at boys, always eager to stir something up. And then it was gone.

"Yes, I said boy. His name is…Ray. That's all he told me." I whispered. 

I felt horrible right now. I was lying to Jessica, lying to Jaz.

Maybe that was a good sign. I knew I wasn't a liar, which was a tiny crack in the identity crises problem dealt with.

"Oh God…that's why you left? We all thought you and Julia had a big fight and you got so angry you ran away. And you're telling me now that you were kidnapped?" Jessica said, and suddenly she rushed to hug me. I leapt into her arms, eager for some semblance of familiarity and comfort. 

The girl was positively drenched in…ketchup. I willed myself to believe it was ketchup. That she'd wrecked the robe specifically to spite some old-timer church elder. She felt me shirk back. 

"What, did you…kill someone?" I asked, partially playing it as a joke, partially serious. I laughed a bit. She didn't.

This was the moment my brain decided to remember I was in a room filled with dozens of dead bodies in various states of dismemberment.

"Julia said you wouldn't understand, but I needed to do this." She said. She looked at me like I was a completely different person. A child failing to grasp the real workings of the world. How the sausage got made.

"You—needed to do this?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. The first time I'd realized Julia's true intentions, it had terrified me. I'd been emotionally out of control, completely incapable of any form of reason. But now I'd matured. Sort of. I knew I had to let Jaz talk.

"I needed to. These people…their sin is vast. They're trying to kill us every chance they get. It's levels of bloodlust, of hatred, like we've never seen before. Some of them…can't be purified. They simply have to be…" Jaz said, then suddenly dropped to a whisper. I could see it in her face. She was trying to sell this to herself as much as she was me. It was like Troy had taught me. The best manipulators got their victims to play apologetics for their philosophy. "…put down." She finished.

I steadied my breathing, and simply began observing like I'd been taught. People's values, how they see things, often leaked out as they talked. How they described things. 

*How do you see the world, Jessica?*

I willed myself to enter her head space.

*Your world has become a world of fear and violence. Of people that have been bent and bent until there was almost no hope left for them. People who've devolved into degeneracy, whose sin is so great it has to be purified forcefully for the good of everyone else. And some of them, you've been convinced, the treatment simply doesn't work on. They have been reduced to animals. There is simply no other choice than to stop them before they hurt yet another person.*

*In your world, you aren't a killer. You are a healer. A purifier. Going to the darkest depths, the most extreme methods, to save people from themselves. You aren't a sadist, you take no joy in this. It is simply your duty, and you were compelled to obey.*

Anna would've recoiled. She would've been horrified. Jessica seemed like a monster in her world, killing sinners when Jessica was no better than they were, mutilating people, causing such terror and hatred and devolving to such insanity that it felt like something must give, something must break. But no. I wasn't quite the same anymore. I'd seen through too many pairs of eyes for this set to horrify me. The horror of it came from somewhere else. 

That it made sense in Jessica's world, and if I'd had the choice, with my mother on her knees in front of me, after everything she'd done, it might have made sense in mine too.

"You think I'm crazy." Jaz said, noticing that I'd been quiet for way too long, and probably seeing the dread on my face.

And suddenly, a hidden part of myself kicked into a high gear. 

"No. I don't. Seeing what you see…doing what you do…it must be brutal." I admitted. "To have to look into their eyes like that. To see them like that. To know they've crossed a line you can't help them uncross."

This had not been the response Jessica'd been expecting, because she just blinked repeatedly. 

"Y-yeah…it's horrible. It feels horrible, every time…" Jaz's voice trailed off. But it wasn't Jaz anymore. Jaz was the natural rebel. Now Jessica, or whoever this was, was following the orders of someone else even when it hurt because of her duty. Jaz would've burned the church to the ground twice over before she'd kill just because some two-bit man or woman in a uniform told her to. 

But I saw the fear in those eyes. And I knew what had happened. I knew exactly what had happened, and it scared me to death. The rebel in Jaz had been slowly beaten and gaslit out of her.

I struggled to breathe.

"…but if Julia says it's my duty to be one of the Devout, then my emotions are just getting in the way." The girl in front of me with the dark brown hair and the faded brownish-white skin, in her white uniform and simple golden cross pendant around her neck, said.

I recognized the words, but not the person speaking them. And that's when I got a terrible, sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. What if Jessica was already gone? Already brainwashed? Would she try kill me once she knew I wasn't falling for the propaganda? Would I have to fight her?

*Would I have to…*

I stared down at the corpses on the floor, their bones jutting out this way and that, my eyes torn to look at them like a car crash.

*Kill her?*

The response I got from the profile of her I'd made in my head made me sick. 

*Welcome to my world, Anna. You'll hate doing it, but you will.*
