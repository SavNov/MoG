* The Beginning
  The introduction is always the hardest part, isn't it?
  Those first few sentences you have with a person, to tell them who you are, what you are, and why they should care. A long time ago, I would've agonized for something like this.
  Now, as the people in the old country like to say: كما تقوم بعملك، دع الله يقوم بعمله.
  Or as those in the perhaps older country like to say: כפי שאתה עושה את שלך, תן לאלוהים לעשות את שלו.

  /To let the Lord do His work as you do yours./
  So I'll do my part. My name is Anna Hawthorne. This is my story. And it starts roughly ten years ago, give or take.
  Me and...her...were on our way to church. The sun was shining, the flowers were blooming, and I could smell her hair from all the way in the backseat of the SUV. It smelled like rosemary and a little bit of myrrh. That was simply how my mother was. Elegant and proper and composed. She had a reputation to maintain after all.
  Even from back here, I could see that not a stitch was out of place on her long, red dress.
  By comparison, I was drab.
  Ankle-length green dress that was patchy in places, holey in others, and not the good kind of holey. I was wearing sneakers. Single-color green sneakers to go with the dress.
  /You would think a Hawthorne of all people would've known to go for the gold./

  We were leaders. Go-getters. The word mom always chose was: Prophets.
  Not technically true, but it served its purpose. Just like we did. That was why we strived so hard to look good, act right, to serve the most. If we fell out of line, mom always said, our church would follow.
  In hindsight, she was right, but that doesn't matter yet.

  Leading meant keeping our cool, even if my mind was racing with doubts and questions.

  My mom seemed...different. Her typical charisma was replaced with something else resembling steely resolve. Something was going to be different about today, and she knew it.

  The SUV slowed down in the church parking lot. I opened my door, and stepped out. The concrete mixed with brick made for a unique texture under my feet.

  "Anna," she said softly as we walked into the service, "Today's about showing what you can do. Something big happens today, and you have a part to play in making it happen."

  Her words were laced with that familiar expectation. What people expected of me. To carry on a legacy I was only just beginning to understand. The legacy of Julia Hawthorne.

  I wanted to live up to it, to be it, to feel like I didn't have to pretend or hide who I truly was. I was Anna, though. Not Anna Hawthorne, but just...Julia's daughter.
  Stepping into the church lobby, a warm glow from overhead lights mixed with holiday decorations set the stage for our Christmas preparations. The scent of pine and hot cocoa wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of hushed conversations. Everywhere I looked were familiar faces adorned with expressions of curiosity and concern.

  The lobby bustled with activity. Volunteers prepared gift baskets, laughing as conversations went on. Despite the festive atmosphere, there was a single question burning on everyone's minds, including mine: Where was Toby?

  We moved through the throng of people, nodding greetings as we made our way to the main doors leading into the sanctuary. The grandeur was unmistakable—stained glass windows casting colorful patterns on the polished wooden floors, pews stretching out like rows of attentive listeners.

  It was hard not to feel overwhelmed by the sheer size of the place and its capacity for hosting so many souls. But as I glanced around at the gathered congregation, I couldn’t help but feel that despite our best efforts, everyone was thinking about the same thing: Tobias's absence had shifted something significant in the church’s dynamic.

  The anticipation hung heavy in the air, a silent prelude to what was set to unfold today—something momentous, as my mother had hinted. Though my role wasn’t entirely clear yet, I sensed it would challenge me in ways I hadn’t anticipated.

  As we found our seats, surrounded by familiar faces, none of them knew how much things were shifting under their feet. I looked at my mother with a mix of admiration and fear—admiration for her confidence, fear that one day those expectations would swallow me whole.

  But today wasn't the day to think about that. Today was about faith, belief, and maybe finding out what it really meant to let God work alongside you.
