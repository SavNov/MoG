I stepped into the church basement, the scent of old wood and incense instantly familiar and comforting. 

*Mmm…home.*

A group of guys from the 'youth group' caught my eye, their voices blended into the soft hum of conversation. Among them, a stranger stood out, his gestures confident, his presence magnetic. Clearly someone was taking a few pages out of my mom's play book. And I was supposed to be the Hawthorne.

I tried to slip by unnoticed, but Auri spotted me and waved me over eagerly. "Anna, come join us!" he called outwarmly. 

I approached…hesitantly, offering a shy smile as I settled next to him. He introduced the stranger as 'Ray', and I nodded politely, curious despite myself.

"Hi," I manage to say softly, meeting Ray's steady gaze.

I was finally able to get a good look at him. He had short black hair freshly combed, a charming smile, piercing blue eyes, and was wearing a black suit. He looked like someone out of a country club, not a relatively backwater church. Everything about him seemed to say 'I'm important and I dress to impress'.

"Nice to meet you, Anna," Ray replied calmly. "Are you a regular here?"

"Yeah," I said, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. "My mom…Julia Hawthorne, she's pretty involved."

I didn't even know why I felt I had to introduce my mother. It felt like saying 'armed gunman' or 'ATM Machine'. But I knew why I'd said it. I wasn't Anna Hawthorne to everybody around. I was Julia Hawthorne's daughter.

Ray's eyebrows raised slightly, a flicker of recognition crossing his face. "Julia Hawthorne," he mused. "She must do a lot around here."

He really did not know a lot about this place, then.

I nodded, a knot forming in my stomach. "Yeah, she's…she's always busy."

Ray leans in, his voice gentle yet probing. "What exactly does your mother do here?"

It seemed so obvious to me that I felt the need to choose my words carefully to avoid making him feel stupid. "She leads ministries, plans events… She's a big part of everything."

Ray nodded, absorbing my words, listening intently. "Sounds like she carries a lot of responsibility."

"Yeah," I admitted with a nervous laugh. "Sometimes it feels like it's all too much. One person can't be expected to do all of it, you know?"

He studied my face intently in that moment, reading me, and I suddenly felt like I was under intense scrutiny. Then he went back to being charming and soothing.

His understanding expression offered me a moment of relief. "Do you help out with the ministries?"

I shook my head, feeling a pang of guilt. "Not really. I try to, but… it's complicated."

And from the look on his face, that look of both concern and empathy, I could tell that he…got it, somehow. He knew.

He listened attentively, asking about the church's activities and community involvement. His questions make me feel strangely validated, as if someone finally gets what I've been going through.

"We don't really have a youth ministry yet, at least nothing once you're out of Sunday school, but we make do." I said. 

"You make do?" He asked. 

"Yeah. We do Bible studies, group conversations, sometimes we do games. All kinds of stuff to help the kids feel more at home here." I said. 

"You don't see yourself as a kid." He noted inquisitively. 

"I guess I don't. Even though a lot of it's meant for me too, I guess it always kind of feels like I'm on the giving end but never…one of them." I said, then paused, realizing I'd said too much.

He didn't seem fazed at all, which stunned me. 

"Like a martyr." He said gently. 

"I guess you could say that, yes." I laughed dryly. 

"I can certainly respect that approach. You give off a general vibe of someone who's always willing to give, even when you've nothing to gain." He said. "I, personally, find that admirable."

I blushed at the compliment.

"Uh…thanks, I guess." I said, not knowing what else to say.

"Um, actually, I don't know why I'm telling you this…" I said, and I really didn't.

"Go on. It's alright." He gave me a smile. 

"…but there was actually this time a few years ago, I think I was 11 or something…" My voice trailing off as I tried to remember how old I'd been. He didn't look caught off-guard. He looked completely engrossed. "…and, see, I saw this book that looked really cool, so I wanted to see the title. But, it's *really* high up, so I can't reach it. So I'm up on my tippy-toes trying to get it, and I almost reach it, but I'm still too short. So I grab a chair, climb on top of it, and I try again. And this time, I grab it properly, but it's way heavier than I thought, so I stumble off the chair and tumble down with it. Only to find out that it's a KJV Bible. We have dozens lying around, and I fell off a chair for this random one."

He looked at me intently, looking surprised. 

"I wasn't really going anywhere with that, I just thought I'd tell you." I admitted. "It seemed right."

He shrugged. 

"You know, don't quote me on this, but I've heard it's the random stories people tell about themselves that reveal the most about them." He said. "And I've always found that very interesting. Because on the surface, it doesn't make any sense. A random story? Why? But if you think more deeply about it, it's something else. It's a gesture of trust."

Then he laughed. A wonderful, gleeful sound. 

"But what do I know? I'm a random teenager. I've never even been to college." He said.

"Now before I get you into trouble, I'd like to know how much exposure you really have to the inner workings of the church. It's fine if you don't know, but do you know, to any extent, what happens behind the curtains?" He asked me, eyeing me carefully.

The group eventually disperses, and I make a quick excuse to leave, seeking solace upstairs where the air feels lighter.

Stepping outside into the cool evening air, I can't shake the feeling that meeting Ray was more than chance. There's just something about him I can't quite place, and it keeps eating away at me.
