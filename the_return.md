*Okay. Act natural. You definitely did NOT just make a deal with a teenage criminal.*
Familiar faces smiled down at me as Jasmine and Carrie patted me on the back.
"Gave them the Hawthorne special, huh?" Jasmine teased me.
I nodded slowly. I played into it.
"So did you charm them into letting you go, or did you scare their pants off?" Carrie asked.
I paused. A beat passed.
*I'm doing a thing called lying. This is wrong.*
I shook the thought out.
*But I have to know…*
"I used my Hawthorne charm. I'm supposed to be my mom's daughter, after all." I said, putting a smile on my face deliberately. She either couldn't see the stress in my face, or more likely, she didn't want to push me on it.
"So what are you going to do first?," Jasmine asked, "Do cartwheels on the tables…finally drink the communion juice…you have options now."
Carrie eyed her sister harshly.
"Not the time, Jaz."
She turned to me. 
"Are you…okay?"
She eyed me like I'd been through hell, which for all she knew, I had. I'd been kidnapped by God-only-knew-who and escaped with my life. That was the story they'd been told. The only thing the police knew that they didn't was that the suspect was a Caucasian male. I'd been told they'd be keeping in touch, and that if I remembered anything else, I should just call them. 
I eyed the piece of paper with the police chief's phone number on it in my pocket.
"Okay? I'm not…sure yet." I said. "I don't know what he wanted, but I don't think he's just going to take it all lying down."
Carrie hugged me gently. 
"Hey, it's going to be okay, the police are gonna catch the guys. I know it." She said, reassuring me.
I simply nodded.
"Now, just focus on getting better. Get some good sleep tonight. You're going to need it with everything your mom has planned. It's already forty strong." She patted me on the back and released me.
*Wait. Forty?!*
"That's a lot of people." I noted, trying to keep the nervousness out of my voice. Just thinking about talking to that many people at once, mentoring that many people at once, made my heart race and palms sweat.
"You're a Hawthorne, you, of all people, can take it." She said.

I was praying she was right as I stepped through the crowd and saw my mom talking up a storm.
"So Ramsey, that's why I was thinkin' we should invest more in community outreach. It would really help, especially with the interest already demonstrated in GMM within the community as it is." Mom finished, her thick southern accent making contractions where contractions simply didn't need to be.
"Hey mom." I said.
She immediately wrapped her arms around me, pulling me into a tight hug. 
"Goodness, honey, I was so worried about you." She said quietly as she went from high-energy to calm in an instant. "Are you okay? Did they hurt you?"
It was certainly odd. She sounded worried sick, but her heartbeat hadn't changed at all. She wasn't tense.
"No, mom, I'm okay." I said. "I talked my way out of it."
I stiffened slightly at the lie, but she either didn't notice or didn't want to push me on it just yet.
"Honey, I just want to say that nobody is expecting you to leap into the fold immediately. These things take time. They always do. So just get some rest, and we'll play this where it lies, alright?" She said.
"I feel fine." I insisted. 
I thought back to the exact conversation with Troy. 
"He didn't even touch me. I'm okay." I said. 
"He?" She paused for a brief moment. "I mean, I suspected it was a male, but the police didn't tell me anything."
She shrugged.
"You let me handle that…situation. Just rest." She reassured me, shining me that familiar smile.
I wanted this. No, I *needed* this. 
"What were you talking about with the leaders?" I asked.
She blinked.
"I was just talking with Ramsey about doing some more community outreach. You may be the…well, not the youth pastor, but…we'll work that out later. You may be the head honcho of God's Might Ministries, but there is a lot of red tape to be dealt with before we can get this thing up and running. Nothing you need to worry about. You just rest and prepare yourself." She said. 
I could hear the silent order in the subtext of her words, the thing every parent is thinking: *Do not embarrass me. I do not want to regret putting you in charge of this.*
She wasn't even wrong. When I got placed in charge of things…they tended to go wrong.
