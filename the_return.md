*Okay. Act natural. You definitely did NOT just make a deal with a teenage criminal.*

Familiar faces smiled down at me as Jasmine and Carrie patted me on the back.

"Gave them the Hawthorne special, huh?" Jasmine teased me.
I nodded.

*What am I doing? I've **never** done this before…*

"So did you charm them into letting you go, or did you scare their pants off?" Carrie asked.

The words rose out of my throat and stood at the tip of my tongue, waiting to escape. 

*So his name is Troy. Troy Lockwood. He's a teenage criminal mastermind, he kidnapped me, and now I'm spying on my own mother for him to prove him wrong.*
That just sounded insane, even though it was the truth.
*I didn't really do any charming or scaring. In fact, he seemed charmless. I didn't need to charm him or scare him, he's just…let me go.*
"You know…" I laughed nervously, twiddling my thumbs at my sides.
*You know…it's really funny. I actually lied to the police for the first time in my life for a boy I've only ever met twice. And now I'm about to spy on my own mother.*
*You know…everything kind of just happened and I don't want to remember the details yet.*

Finally, my mind produced a reply I could use. He'd given me advice I could actually use for once in my life, advice not catered by mom into a cookie-cutter mold of a charming and powerful heir.
*Play into their expectations. Be who they think you are, and let their memories fill in the gaps.*
Turns out, people don't actually see you. They see the version of you they have in their heads. And when the version before them conflicts with the one they have in their heads, he'd explained, most people choose to stick to the latter, because changing your mind is hard.
*I'm doing a thing called lying. This is wrong.*
I shook the thought out.
*But I have to know…*
"I used my Hawthorne charm. I'm supposed to be my mom's daughter, after all." I said, putting a smile on my face deliberately. And to my utter surprise, it actually seemed…to work.
"So what are you going to do first?," Jasmine asked, "Do cartwheels on the tables…finally drink actual communion wine…you have options now."
Carrie eyed her sister harshly.
"Not the time, Jaz."

Jasmine was upbeat. A bit of a rebel, yes, but she was an expert at keeping things light. I remembered when, in third grade, she'd pretended to be drunk after drinking the communion juice, causing riots of laughter throughout the Sunday school classroom. I'd tried my best not to laugh, as I knew who my mom was. I'd failed, as usual.
I tried not to remember just how alone I'd felt.
Carrie turned to me.
"Are you…okay?"
She eyed me like I'd been through hell, which for all she knew, I had. I'd been kidnapped by God-only-knew-who and escaped with my life. The only thing the police knew that they didn't was that the suspect was a Caucasian male, so my friends probably knew even less.
*We'll be keeping in touch, Ms. Hawthorne. So please, if you remember anything at all about your assailant, give me a call at the number on that piece of paper.*
I eyed the piece of paper with the police chief's phone number on it in my pocket.
*Okay? Was I **really** okay?*
"Okay? I'm not…sure yet." I said. "I don't know what he wanted, but I don't think he's just going to take it all lying down."
Carrie hugged me gently. 
"Hey, it's going to be okay, the police are gonna catch the guys. I know it." She said, reassuring me.
I simply nodded.
"Now, just focus on getting better. Get some good sleep tonight. You're going to need it with everything your mom has planned. It's already forty strong." She patted me on the back and released me.
*Wait. Forty?!*
"That's a lot of people." I noted, trying to keep the nervousness out of my voice. Just thinking about talking to that many people at once, mentoring that many people at once, made my heart race and palms sweat.
"You're a Hawthorne, you, of all people, can take it." She said.

I was praying she was right as I stepped through the crowd and saw my mom talking up a storm.
"So Ramsey, that's why I was thinkin' we should invest more in community outreach. It would really help, especially with the interest already demonstrated in GMM within the community as it is." Mom finished, her thick southern accent making contractions where contractions simply didn't need to be.
I'd expected to inherit my mother's accent, but even that aspect of her seemed to be beyond me.
"Hey mom." I said.
She immediately wrapped her arms around me, pulling me into a tight hug. 
"Goodness, honey, I was so worried about you." She said quietly as she went from high-energy to calm in an instant. "Are you okay? Did they hurt you?"
Sudden changes in energy were nothing out of the ordinary for her. Being what people needed to be was a strength of hers.
I did notice something odd in that moment, though. Tobias had died only a couple of days ago. I had just been kidnapped. Yet the only part of her that felt remotely tense was her words.
"No, mom, I'm okay." I said.
"Honey, I just want to say that nobody is expecting you to leap into the fold immediately. These things take time. They always do. So just get some rest, and we'll play this where it lies, alright?" She said.
"Is it really…?" I asked, unsure of how to put it. "Forty?"
"Yes. I know that must seem overwhelming to someone like you, but I encourage you to push your limits. Learn by doing. Face your fears." She soothed, gently massaging my shoulders. "Now, I'm sure your recent experience has left you…less than okay mentally. Get some rest."
I paused this time.
"How are you…holding up?" I asked.
She…relaxed, slightly.
"It's been hard…" She began. "…without him around, I mean. He was such a big influence on our community, it doesn't feel right to not have him around anymore."
Then she smiled. 
"But that's why so it's so important that we make this place feel like home. It's what he would've wanted."
I missed Toby even more than she did. He was the closest thing I had to a dad. And I knew she was right about that. He had always talked about making this place a home for the outcasts, the misfits, the people that this modern world had chewed up and spat out battered and broken. Or, as he'd said himself, that the world considered worthless was going to be the foundation of our church.
Two thousand years ago, another man had proudly declared that the stone the builders rejected was going to become the cornerstone. In our weakness, we would be made strong.
