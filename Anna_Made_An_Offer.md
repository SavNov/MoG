Her words caught in the back of her throat. 
*What?!*
"You're...you're what?" She asked incredulously.
Her feet stomped on the hard floor. He just looked at her the way you looked at a toddler having a tantrum, just waiting for the waterworks to run its course.
"You're...you're not serious." She said, unable to believe it. "You're not..."
He met her eye. There was no way he was lying.
"I am." He said.

It took her several minutes to process the fact that she'd just made a deal with a career criminal. Someone evil. The enemy, basically.
*I just made a deal with the devil...and I didn't even see it coming. Okay...*
He just went back to sitting in his chair, giving her time to process. He wasn't even enjoying it. He looked bored.
Once she'd calmed down enough to think straight, she forced herself to face him.
"Let me get this straight." She said, forcing the words to come out calm despite her clearly not being.
"You." She said.
"I." He repeated back to her.
"Want me." She said.
"Want you." He repeated.
"To help you."
"To help me."
"Spy."
"Spy."
"On my church."
"On your church."

He didn't look fazed. 
"And you're basically a career criminal." She emphasized.
"As far as you're concerned, yes." He answered.
"And you didn't think to tell me this earlier."
"The longer you spend in my world, the more you'll learn that it doesn't matter." He said.
His tone never wavered. He explained this like it was a mathematical formula. Or maybe some kind of office rule.
Not like he was confessing to being a career criminal.
"What do you do?" She asked. 
He leaned against the desk. She suddenly found herself wondering if the desk was even his, or if he'd stolen it.
"It's the only thing in this building that's mine." He replied.
"How did you-"
"I read your expression." He answered, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. "As for what I do...that's more complicated."
He studied her like he was dissecting her with nothing but his mind. She immediately got the feeling that he didn't need a scalpel to know what made her tick. And all of a sudden the pieces began falling into place. 
*He made me an offer to be a spy citing that my mother was a bad person, and that to prove her innocence I needed to work with him and get him information. Knowing that it would make me eager to help him. He presented it as being able to become my true self knowing that's what I craved for so long.*
Her mind was racing at a mile a minute.
*What else does he know about me-?*
"As for your next question, I know quite a lot about you. Not as much as I should, but quite a lot." He said, seeming to read her mind. 
*I should assume he's telepathic until further notice.*
"Yes, you probably should." He said, flatly.
