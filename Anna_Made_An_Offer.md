My words caught in the back of my throat. 

*What?!*

"You're…you're what?" I asked incredulously.

My feet stomped on the hard floor. He just looked at me the way you looked at a toddler having a tantrum, just waiting for the waterworks to run its course.

"You're…you're not serious." I said, unable to believe it. "You're not…"

He met my eye. There was no way he was lying.

"I am." He said.

It took me several minutes to process the fact that I'd just made a deal with a career criminal. Someone evil. The enemy, basically.

*I just made a deal with the devil…and I didn't even see it coming. Okay…*

He just went back to sitting in his chair, giving me time to process. He wasn't even enjoying it. He looked bored.

Once I'd calmed down enough to think straight, I forced myself to face him.

"Let me get this straight." I said, forcing the words to come out calm despite my clearly not being.

"You." I said.

"I." He repeated back to me.

"Want me." I said.

"Want you." He repeated.

"To help you."

"To help me."

"Spy."

"Spy."

"On my church."

"On your church."

He didn't look fazed. 

"And you're basically a career criminal." I emphasized.

"As far as you're concerned, yes." He answered.

"And you didn't think to tell me this earlier."

"The longer you spend in my world, the more you'll realize that's just a detail." He said.

His tone never wavered. He explained this like it was a mathematical formula. Or maybe some kind of office rule.

Not like he was confessing to being a career criminal.

"What do you do?" I asked. 

He leaned against the desk. I suddenly found myself wondering if the desk was even his, or if he'd stolen it.

"It's the only thing in this building that's mine." He replied.

"How did you-"

"I read your expression." He answered, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. "As for what I do…that's more complicated."

He studied me like he was dissecting me with nothing but his mind. I immediately got the feeling that he didn't need a scalpel to know what made me tick. And all of a sudden the pieces began falling into place. 

*He made me an offer to be a spy telling me that my mother was a bad person, and that to prove my innocence I needed to work with him and get him information. Knowing that it would make me eager to help him. He presented it as being able to become my true self knowing that's what I craved for so long.*

My mind was racing at a mile a minute.

*What else does he know about me-?*

"As for your next question, I know quite a lot about you. Not as much as I should, but quite a lot." He said, seeming to read my mind. 

*I should assume he's telepathic until further notice.*

"Yes, you probably should." He said, flatly.

"How do you—do that?" I asked, now just as curious as I was concerned.

He took on an almost pensive look, like he was deciding how much to reveal. Then he held my gaze.

"There are certain things that drive people. And things they are afraid of. But you want a more direct answer rather than a dissertation, I assume." He said. 

I nodded. 

"You'd be surprised how much a person reveals about themselves without even realizing it. Your clothes are hand-sewn, and given your apparent attachment to them, you sewed them yourself. That's a sign of self-reliance. Your hair is wild and unruly, telling others you don't care how it looks. And yet…when made to meet a little bit of authority, even if it's only perceived, you crumble. You either make nice or you dig your heels in. That tells me a relationship or two was very one-sided." He said. "Based on the way your mind works, I can make an educated guess as to where it goes from second to second. That's why it seems as though I can read your thoughts."

Some of it was a bit over my head, but I understood what he was saying. He was making observations, and working backwards to determine who had made those details happen.
