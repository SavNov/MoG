**Zara’s day begins with a flurry of motion.** She stirs awake to the sound of a soft chiming from an alarm clock she invented herself, which, to anyone else, would be confusing—a series of strange mechanical clicks and whirs before a voice softly recites a random fact about quantum physics. Her room is an explosion of color and chaos, with stacks of books teetering on the edge of desks, a half-dismantled radio lying beside a pile of glitter markers, and posters of constellations pinned haphazardly to the ceiling. Clothes are strewn across a chair, an unfinished math puzzle lies across her bed, and a corkboard on the wall is crammed with photographs, notes, and odd bits of string connecting them all in an intricate, if somewhat nonsensical, web.

The first thing she does is mutter the periodic table backward under her breath—a self-imposed ritual she’s perfected over the years, a way to clear her mind before the day starts. The exercise has become almost meditative, a comforting challenge to ground her before she leaps into whatever new problem captures her attention today.

Downstairs, she finds her father, Troy, at the dining room table, which is covered in stacks of papers, old books, and arcane-looking devices. He’s wearing a crisp, well-ironed shirt, looking as if he’s just stepped out of a board meeting rather than the heart of their sprawling, eclectic home. Without looking up from the notes he’s meticulously jotting down, he greets her in his usual, precise manner. 

“Morning, Zara. Today’s focus will be on the principles of illusionary mechanics,” he says, sliding a thick tome across the table toward her with surgical precision. “Chapter four, pay attention to the footnotes. There’s a riddle embedded in the text. I expect you to find it by noon.”

Zara gives a small nod, more interested in the stack of blueprints poking out from under the tome. But she respects her father enough to give the book a cursory glance, planning to skim it before getting to what she *really* wants to do. Her curiosity is piqued by the word “illusionary”—her recent encounter with a flickering shadow in her peripheral vision springs to mind. Maybe this isn’t such a boring task after all.

**Anna breezes into the room with an easy energy.** She's dressed in comfortable clothes, her hair still slightly damp from a shower, and she playfully swipes a piece of toast from Zara's plate. “Hey, kiddo,” she grins, “Don’t let your father drown you in all his footnotes and riddles. Save some brain cells for our training later.”

Her mother’s lightheartedness is a breath of fresh air, a stark contrast to Troy’s intense focus. Anna moves through the space with a certain ease, grabbing a cup of coffee and leaning against the kitchen counter. Her environment is much more laid back—plants in various states of health, a well-used punching bag hanging from a hook, and a stack of canvases covered in bold, expressive paintings against the wall. 

After breakfast, Anna insists on some physical training. They head to the backyard, where Anna sets up a series of agility drills. Unlike Troy’s analytical approach, Anna’s method is more fluid, adaptive, and fun. She encourages Zara with a mix of enthusiasm and competition, pushing her to improve while making it feel more like a game than a chore. Zara rolls her eyes but secretly enjoys these sessions, knowing they’re a way for her mother to connect and impart her own lessons in discipline and resilience.

**After the workout, Troy resumes the lessons, this time with a different focus.** They retreat to his study, a place that’s both intimidating and fascinating to Zara. The space is overflowing with ancient texts, mysterious artifacts, and the unmistakable scent of old parchment. Yet everything has its place, even the mess seems deliberate, a careful balancing act between chaos and order. He hands her a manuscript without any preamble.

“Dissect this,” he instructs, “Not literally, but mentally. I want to know what the author is hiding in his language, what secrets are buried between the lines.”

She takes it, intrigued by the challenge, knowing that beneath his rigid exterior, her father is constantly testing her, pushing her to think beyond the obvious. 

**The afternoon is hers,** and she uses it to tinker in the garage, which is her personal sanctuary. Here, she can be as messy and unrestrained as she likes. Tools, wires, and bits of metal are scattered around. Her latest project, a device meant to pick up faint ethereal frequencies, lies in pieces on her workbench. She’s been working on it for weeks, driven by a strange urge to know more about the whispers she’s heard lately—the whispers that feel like they’re calling to her from just beyond the edge of understanding.

She loses track of time as she works, her fingers moving deftly, her mind racing ahead. A soft hum fills the room as she powers up the device, a grin spreading across her face as it flickers to life. The hum grows louder, and for a moment, she swears she sees a shimmer in the air, like a ripple in reality itself. She leans in closer, her heart pounding with excitement.

Then, a voice, soft and insidious, creeps into her mind: “What is Heaven hiding?”

She pulls back, startled, looking around, but there’s no one there. Just the quiet of the garage and the faint hum of her contraption. She shudders slightly but brushes it off. The question lingers, though, sticking in her mind like a splinter.

**By dinner, she’s distracted,** turning over the day’s events in her head. Her parents notice—Troy with a knowing look, Anna with a hint of concern—but they say nothing, waiting for Zara to come to them if she wants to. Afterward, she heads outside, finding solace under the night sky, the stars twinkling down like puzzle pieces waiting to be assembled.

She gazes toward the distant Holy Temple, her thoughts racing. She knows she shouldn’t, but the pull of the unanswered questions is too strong. She’ll figure this out on her own, she decides. She’s always been good at puzzles. And maybe, just maybe, she’ll find out what her parents aren’t telling her. 

As she drifts off to sleep, she’s already planning her next move, unaware that she’s treading closer to the Beast’s trap, her mind teetering on the edge between curiosity and danger.
