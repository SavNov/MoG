Zara, like her parents before her, are tragedies waiting to happen that will then be dug out of their ruts through faith and inner strength. But those tragedies have to happen first. 
The darkness brewing inside of Zara is two-fold. 
Her mother's angelic power is both ruthless and pragmatic, yet she also has a can-do-will-do attitude that keeps her going when nothing else will. She leaps head long into things. No half measures. She approaches the world with a laid back ease tempered with this iron resolve. She's either right, or she's wrong, with no in between. 
But Zara doesn't also come with the constant self-questioning of morality that her mother does, which is a dangerous combination.
Her father's demonic power is a different beast entirely. It's ruthless, it's pragmatic, but rather than being I-alone-can-fix-it like Anna's, it's more apathetic. Morality is irrelevant. The emotions of others are irrelevant. And deep inside is a soul that doesn't care if the world burns as long as it gets what it wants in the end. While Anna approaches the world with a laid back ease tempered with iron resolve, Troy comes at the world with an iron seriousness tempered with a lazy curiosity. 
A calculating engine, a machine, but Zara doesn't also come with an inner child at heart that just wants to know how stuff works, she sees puzzles as challenges. The knowledge itself isn't valuable, merely the fact that she has it.
