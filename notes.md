Okay, so I write by explanation. How do I work with that?

This isn't one story. This is the intersection of three/four stories.

Life is a series of moments. This is a series of scenes.

I'm trying to submerge her the entire time in the criminal world, giving her a series of choices that force her to redefine herself and rediscover who she is. But that simply isn't going to work. That doesn't accomplish what I want to do here. Light and dark mixing. Good and evil blurring. Plunging her into evil won't work, she needs both.

She needs to feel torn between two worlds. Who is she going to be? What is she going to follow? What is she going to choose to believe is right and wrong?

Why is she torn?

Why does Troy need her?

She's his way in. She's the one on the inside. She's the spy. She's torn between two versions of herself, but only because of her fear of not
meeting expectations. Her journey is learning to accept good enough. To
accept herself.

To meet herself where she's at.

That's Troy's failure too. He's constantly second-guessing himself.
He sees social situations differently, sees her differently, and is afraid
to connect with her because it means stepping out into the open, it
means being vulnerable, and what if she sees the real him and
hates/fears him for it?

Until life forces his hand. He's forced to be totally vulnerable,
totally open...but he's finally able to reconnect with himself. "I
know
what to do now. I'm not normal. I don't play by the same rules. So
I'm going to have to do this my own way."
Anna scares Troy because his normal methods of interacting with people
aren't working. She's civilian. She's different. As his usual 
communication arsenal fails to solve the problem, he gets scared because 
he feels stupid and weak. And so he withdraws, which only worsens the problem.

Our introduction to Anna is one of internal conflict. She's at church,
and she just knows in her gut that this isn't right. She's tired of
failing, she's following all of the rules but can't seem to see the
rewards she's been promised. She just wants to make her mother proud of
her, to be the passionate leader and good successor that she's been expected 
to be all her life. Her experience with leadership has been saturated by cowardice. 
She can't stand up, she can't interject, she can't lead, and when she does she goes 
against the mold and only feels more alone.

Then Julia opens up God's Might Ministries, and Anna finally sees her
chance to be...something. Anything. She desperately wants this, and
she's funneled straight into it. She's the daughter of Julia Hawthorne.
This is her chance to make her mark.

There's a celebration, and she's on cloud nine, and she's also
sweating bullets and absolutely terrified of messing up. After all, 
this is HER chance. If she messes this up...the possibility is too 
terrifying to even consider.

Someone passes her a drink. It's a boy her age. He looks out of place.

She doesn't question it. She drinks it.

Her body suddenly feels like it weighs a hundred pounds, and she tries 
to fight but she can't, then another boy comes in making a beeline for her.

Auri fights him off, Auri has the advantage, but he's in shock. This boy...
knows how to fight. He's moving in ways she's only ever seen in movies, 
and sometimes in ways she's never seen before. Auri might have the superior 
athletics, but the boy clearly has more fight experience. A lot more. The 
boy who offered her the drink begins dragging her, rather weakly and awkwardly, 
across the floor and towards a side exit. Auri ignores the boy and goes after 
the more pressing danger, which forces the boy to switch targets.

She hears something fly through the air. She hears a sudden groan of pain and 
the sound of bones grinding against flesh. She hears a loud thud.

The second boy is now carrying her alongside the first boy, and Auri is nowhere 
to be seen.

*That boy...oh my god...that boy killed Auri!*

With a simple hit to the face, she loses consciousness.

When she wakes up again, everything feels fuzzy and heavy. She can't

think. Then she does, and she begins to remember. And she cries. She

grieves. And she's completely terrified. These people killed Auri, are

they going to kill her?

When Troy introduces himself, it's cold and flat and pragmatic. She's

screaming at him for killing Auri. And he just...corrects her
awkwardly.

Who's Auri?

Oh, that boy who got in the way? No, he didn't kill Auri, and neither

did Kai. Auri took a knife to the shoulder, but it was far from a fatal

wound. Meant to incapacitate, not kill.

She's thrown off her game, not knowing how to react. Evidently he's a

little confused too. He apologizes for the messy nature, insisting that

he was missing information or else he would've planned better.

Right when she starts to empathize with him, he breaks the moment off by

presenting her with information. The Might of God is evil. Her mother

leads it. The random violence she's heard about, the things being
traced

back to RS and tied to gang violence, are actually Julia's work. All he

needs from her is information.

She closes up emotionally and refuses to listen to a word out of his

mouth. The moment she gets out of here, she's going to scream and her

mother is going to come find her. He's going to go to prison for a very

long time.

The part about her mother coming to find her seems to chill him for

reasons she can't explain, nor does she care to notice.

He tries something else.

"It seems like you're scared and angry. You don't want to be here.
You

just want to go home and be tucked into bed and forget any of this ever

happened. That's what I'm hearing from you."

"Well, YEAH! YOU KIDNAPPED ME!"

"Let's play out that scenario. If you went home right now, what would

you do?"

She was confused. She could think of a laundry list of things she wanted

to do. Friends, maybe sports, maybe school, maybe church...all those

familiar things.

"She told you that following all the rules would make you happy,
didn't

she? That to be her successor was your purpose, what you were made
for."

"How do you-"

"But what does that even mean? How are you meant to know if that's

really what your purpose is? You've followed all the rules for a while,

right? Do you feel happy?"

She was conflicted. Because she didn't know. She didn't feel happy.

"I'm definitely not happy about you kidnapping me."

"Even I released you right now, would you be happy in a few days, a
week

maybe?"

"Certainly would be better than this."

He held the silence.

"I...I don't know. I'm not used to having philosophical conversations with kidnapper psychos."

"I'm not a psycho- oh nevermind, you don't care. What I'm offering
you

is an opportunity. To do something different."

"You're here to...recruit me? I'm here to...be recruited?"

"I'm here to offer a trade. I'll teach you the tricks of my trade,
and

you'll teach me the tricks of yours."

"I don't...have a trade. And what do you mean by your trade? Teaching
me

how to kidnap people?"

"The human body is a map that, if read correctly, can tell you about
the

human mind. People are puzzles, but they can be solved. I can teach you

how to read the map, how to figure out how someone thinks, how to deduce

what they'll do next. And Kai can teach you how to do what he does. How

to fight. How to move the ways you saw him move. How to turn a knife

into a deadly weapon."

"So what do you do?"

"Me and Kai are a two-man band. I'm the brains of the operation."

She stared at him.

"I run a tiny little crime empire just scraping by." He sighed.

"What's...my trade...then?"

"You're the leader of God's Might Ministries, are you not?"

"That...doesn't count. I don't actually run anything. I only

started...today."

"Teach me how your church works, how your mother thinks, what she

believes. I call it a fair trade, what do you think?"

Anna watches with increasing dread as the church she initially saw as

distant becomes ever more robotic, warped and distorted. It's still

alive, but it's steadily lobotimized.

Julia stood proud. She looked over the army of angels with visible

respect and appreciation.

"I'm going to bring you down." Anna said defiantly.

"Oh, my daughter, I couldn't be more proud." Julia smiled, with
genuine

reverence.

"W-what?" Anna asked, raising an eyebrow, visibly surprised and
shocked.

"What do you mean 'proud'?"

"You lead an army worthy of the Might of God. Your purpose is to kill

demons. We may disagree on who the demons are...but at least after all

these years I know my daughter is on the right track." Julia smiled,

looking visibly at ease.

It was unnerving.

Anna looked uneasy. Her eyes kept flitting from side to side, looking to

her soldiers for guidance.

"This isn't...this army isn't like yours." Anna replied.

*We may disagree on who the demons are...but at least after all these

years I know my daughter is on the right track.*

*Your purpose is to kill demons.* Those were Lucifer's words, not

Julia's. Spoken years ago, in a fairy tale, where Auri was still alive

and Troy was still on her side.

She was an angel, through and through.

*Our purpose was to be warriors, and that was a terrible sacrifice, but

one we made willingly. War was hard, war was hell, but we were willing

to endure hell so that you humans could see a slice of heaven.*

*Then Lucifer crafted a story of proud warriors destroying demons like

cannon fodder and becoming heroes. Hell became the big enemy. Humanity

became a token we used to justify our actions.*

*Wait...* She thought.

*Your purpose is to kill demons.*

*"My purpose is to kill demons." She rehearsed the words in her mind.

"Destroy the enemy. Punish the evildoers."*

What had the words been again?

"Lucifer wasn't wrong, per se, but his view was inverted. He was

focusing on the wrong thing."

"You lead an army worthy of the Might of God. Your purpose is to kill

demons."

But the Lord's Power did not make Him righteous. Jesus hadn't won by

destroying the enemy.

Jesus had conquered the grave two millennia ago by surrendering to it.

It made sense now.

A savior arrives on the battlefield on a white imperial
horse...drenched

in his own blood without even carrying a sword. No armor. No weapons. No

traditional ways of representing power.

If Christ had wanted the demons gone, He could've rained hellfire upon

them like Sodom and Gomorrah for as long as He needed to. Yet He


A savior who conquers by doing the opposite. A savior who begs them to

accept forgiveness. An army at the end of days, that wins by dying.
Anna starts out with doubts and insecurities. She’s a teenage girl, more introverted and reserved, with a good heart and a strong faith. Her entire life has been a sheltered one, a life that most Christians would call a good one. She goes to a private Christian academy, where she seems to have a few good friends. She shies away from talking to the teachers, but the audience can definitely tell she has a strong grasp on the moral groundings, the love, forgiveness, compassion and generosity, that sits at the center of Christianity as a whole. She attends her church, and the problem becomes clear: She despises the crowds. She finds it overwhelming, and ends up making a fool of herself. How? By making a bee-line for her seat, keeping her head down, and keeping quiet. The whole time, she loathes herself for these traits, and silently wishes she was more like her mother.

Julia is practically the opposite, and she makes that known. Julia is wearing a perfect smile wherever she goes, wearing a beautiful dress, and happily striking up conversations with person after person. She’s gregarious, charming, outgoing, and definitely a go-getter willing to chase after ‘Jesus’ with everything she’s got. Julia also manages to sit among groups of Christian women and retell her experiences, creating moments of emotional connection.

While Anna is with Julia as she walks through the crowd, it’s not until the group scene that we understand the sense of insecurity that Anna has. 

Anna feels incredibly awkward, and seems to put her mother on a pedestal. Her mother reminds her of everything she isn’t. Julia is everything a Christian woman is supposed to be. Our first encounter with Julia is her chatting it up happily with a group of women in a circle, talking about her life, sharing funny stories, never being caught down-wind. Then Anna, our protagonist, is invited into the group by Julia, and promptly bombs her audition. She’s avoiding eye contact like the plague, leaving pauses where she should be laughing, and not able to resonate with these women on any kind of serious level. 

We’re given a few scenes that communicate to us that this scenario has been perpetuating itself for a long time. 

Anna starts hearing news reports on TV and social media suggesting the rise of a domestic terrorism group. The group, uncannily, calls itself the ‘Might of God’, and the letters ‘MoG’ are imprinted as a sort of logo. Although, when Anna starts hearing a few of the public speeches given by this group, she honestly can’t believe that they are truly terrorists. These terrorist protest excessively and insist that God’s church has become complacent to the influence of the world. That Christians are being persecuted heavily in the United States, being tossed out of schools, universities, and being attacked in public forums. In response to bombings and shootings bearing the emblem of ‘MoG’, they blame it on gang wars. 

Even more confusing is a specific gang, RS, that it keeps getting pinned on. While the gang insists that they have nothing to do with it, a blame game continues between the two.

The more Anna sees in the news, the more her Christian private school seems to rally behind them. The notes of schools, universities and public forums having the Christians driven into exile out of them hit many hard. There’s a certain aspect to the feeling of religious persecution in the face of Atheism, Islam, and ‘Science’ that truly resonates with a significant majority of Christians. And, after all, who wouldn’t want to fight back? Not to mention, who wouldn’t want to get some payback on an evil gang?

Except…Anna happens to turn the opposite direction. She still believes that Christians are called to lives of servitude, of turning the other cheek, of unconditional love. Yet her attempts only backfire and fail. She never is able to summon the nerve, she doesn’t have the charisma, she isn’t outgoing enough to get a crowd on her side. If only she could be more like her mother…

In fact, her attempts at turning those around her back in the right direction are seeming to turn them even more against her. With so much of her church standing against her, Anna is starting to believe the problem is with her instead of her church. Her faith is in crisis. And then, when she heads off to a gas station to simply clear her head, she’s kidnapped by a teenage boy that seems to have fighting skills better than anything she’s ever seen. After she’s knocked out, she wakes up in a wooden chair, and meets the strangest boy she’s ever met: Ray Simmons, or RS. The most startling thing to her is how much they have in common. 

Ray Simmons, or Troy Lockwood, is a taller teenage boy with black hair, blue eyes, and wearing a black business suit. Strangely, he seems to have two sides: One naturally charismatic side cracking jokes and smiles and immediately able to connect with her. And another side, a more calm and analytical side, more awkward and cautious, dissecting her behaviors without judgement and working to steadily understand her. 

Anna immediately takes a liking to him, even if there seem to be two very different sides. And that’s when he slowly, almost like a kind professor, explains to her the situation with her mother. Julia has been so enthusiastic about the church getting behind this Might of God terror group because she is the head of it. Instead of arguing with her about how his gang would never shoot or bomb places, he instead shows her how resource-barren they are, and lets her eyes confirm for her that RS literally could not have pulled off the acts that Might of God is accusing them of. He doesn’t lie to Anna, not even once. He’s fully up front that he’s the leader of a gang. And he tells her she’s more than free to walk away, he’ll understand if she wants to take her own path in dealing with Julia. She wonders if she’s being expertly manipulated by a gang leader. She decides that even if she is, she’s not going to be able to take on Julia alone.

Then we’re introduced to the relationship between Julia and Ray, how Ray is utterly fearless, and how he and Julia have known each other as sworn enemies for a long time. He calmly tells her, whilst staring into the barrel of a gun, that ‘I have your daughter.’ and revealing Anna’s credentials to prove it.

Julia calmly tells him that if Anna is taking his side, then she’s dead to her, and here we see the true side of Julia. Who is simultaneously all of Anna’s insecurities embodied and all of her fears confirmed.

And thus, we’re brought into the central conflict: Anna is training to defeat her mother and take back her church, and Ray is playing several different games at once to keep Julia at bay. Meanwhile, the violence only continues. We’re introduced to Kai as Anna’s trainer. His question: “You were easy to beat.” tells us that is the same boy that kidnapped Anna, and that Ray is far from alone. While Ray was charismatic, Kai is a stubborn and arrogant boy, refusing to believe that a girl with no time on the streets is even worth training. Anna grows to actively dislike Kai, even though she’s coming along well. Kai, for the sake of his own pride, refuses to praise Anna’s progress so far.

At the same time, Ray is dealing with interference, and we see a silent war play out between Julia and Troy. Troy shows his abilities in synthesizing drugs, and his other side, Ray,’s charm in selling them and marketing them to others. He convinces a girl by the name of Lexie, who has dark brown hair, olive skin, hazel eyes, and who decides to wear a simple yellow t-shirt and khakis.

Lexie is more of a tomboy-type, so  Ray markets the meth to her as a stimulant that will help her get ahead. Ray is calm, charming, funny, and knows how to make himself more attractive as a distraction. He expertly makes use of emotional triggers to seal the deal with Lexie. He even uses his own clothing, in this case wearing a tank top and basketball shorts, not just to highlight his body to increase his attractive appeal, but also to help her see him as a friend and equal, making her more likely to trust him.

Then Ray convinces an older man by the name of Travis, who has pepper grey hair, white skin, green eyes, and who decides to wear a polo shirt and dress pants.

Travis is an investment banker with a soul-grinding job that is very wealth but far from happy. so Ray markets the cocaine as a way to add some pleasure to his life and keep him sane. He, again, makes masterful use of emotional triggers to seal the deal, telling Travis that he believes Travis is an intelligent enough man to use the cocaine safely and discreetly. Travis makes use of wearing a dark brown blazer and formal dress pants, making a quick excuse that he wears tennis shoes because ‘the store I go to didn’t have anything formal in colors that would work with his outfit’. 

All of this asks the question of whether Troy’s entire connection with Anna is one of him manipulating her to do what he wants, using her desire to fight and stop Julia against her.

We use the headlines to swing back to Julia, in a mirror to the scene of Anna’s initial insecurity, but this time the entire place is different. Julia is talking about building ‘God’s Army on Earth’ to ‘take back this world from the hands of the enemy’. She wants to use this army to combat the Atheists, Scientists, Muslims, and various other powers she sees as enemies to Christianity. The most noticeable difference is that a few of the men and women are now holding weapons, which alludes to what group is really in control of this church.

Except we aren’t simply dealing with a rogue church now, the effects of the violence that Julia has been instigating are causing a general hatred of Christians in particular. The word ‘Christian’ is becoming synonymous with ‘terrorist’ just like the word Muslim did in the War on Terror. Politicians are now seen campaigning on how they will mitigate the threat of Christianity. Christian churches are frequently being investigated for terrorist activity, and just like the War on Terror, they aren’t doing it out in the open. If they don’t find something to prosecute on, police are simply holding them in prison for three days until they find something. But there ae other, more subtle ways that the United States is attacking these Christians. These biases against them are causing them to be excluded from job offers, mortgages, and having their accounts frozen/closed until they can be cleared of any suspected terrorist activity. But none of these are made obvious. Instead, they are subtle, through clever bits of dialogue, mentions of headlines in the background, and subtle allusions to greater issues involved. 

But as Anna continues to train, she finds herself in a strange position: When she’s not trying to play a social game, or trying to resonate with stories, or trying to have some grand emotional impact, she finds she is resonating with people. 

Anna finds herself having just finished an intensive training session, and she’s sitting next to an 8-year-old boy who has lived on the streets for the past three years, getting by on scraps. This is someone she has nothing in common with. At least, that’s what she thinks. Until she hears his story.

Chuck was five years old when he ran away from his parents. They were fighting, and he was scared, so he ran. And he just…didn’t come back. They hung out missing posters with his face on it, and he hid. He bounced between homeless shelters, evaded cops, and generally tried to survive on the streets. And Anna just says “I have no idea how that feels. But now I have to know. What was that like?” And she just sits there with this kid for like an hour, listening to him cry and whine and shout and tell her that he’s sorry and that he’s terrified and scared. She could tell him off, and she could bring him to the police, and she could bring him back to his parents, but she does none of that. She just sits there and grieves with him. Then she grabs some food with him, and she just lets him talk. And it has a lasting impact on him.

She walks away feeling uncertain, nervous, and like she should’ve done more for him, but she finally asks a key question: “Was that the Christian thing to do?” She argues with herself that she never even brought up the name of Christ, nor did she get him to join a church, nor did she even take out a Bible. And she calmly tells herself that she should’ve done better.

It highlights a misconception in Anna's worldview, about what it means to be a Christian. Her belief is that Christian hyper-evangelism is the only way to connect others to Christ. Succinctly, Anna sees the Bible as something to relay to others, instead of something to mirror. Spending so much time with her mother Julia has taught her that faith is something purely external, leading her to completely disregard what Christ has already done to shape her internally. 

Similar to how scripture works, just when we think that Anna has learned her lesson about how faith really works, she falls back on that same misconception. She goes through a subplot of meeting another drug kingpin, this one named Joseph Nally. He's a direct competitor to Ray, and quietly remarks that Anna is being completely manipulated by Ray, but that as much as he hates Ray, he's not about to spoil Ray's fun. There are certain allusions to Ray's past like ‘rich boy's and ‘walker’s son’ that we don't understand, but they seem to be common knowledge to everyone besides us. 

Joseph Nally hates Ray because of his own beliefs that Ray comes from a wealthy upbringing and seems to be used to getting what he wants without question. He views Ray as cocky and arrogant. Including such wonderful things as “Kidnapping the daughter of Julia Hawthorne? He must be crazy, or stupid, or want to end up dead.” And “Doesn't even respect a gun held to his forehead.” Joseph Nally had to fight and kill and steal for everything he got, and lived in a world flooded at the seams with paranoia. As a result, he sees Ray's inherent calm and ease as foolish arrogance. He's “practically asking to be betrayed”. 

But Anna has been taught to read emotions, and starts reading Joseph. And as she throws ideas around, she starts picking up on his past. She starts actively listening to him. Even if she's convinced that the external world is all there is with people, and that what people praise and idealize will be apparent by what they do, and therefore can be manipulated easily, you can't fake emotion. At least, not easily. She walks into the encounter with the expectation that this person is completely different from her. Joseph Nally is a drug kingpin, and she's a teenage girl who doesn't know the first thing about drugs. 

She doesn't bother criticizing his actions. For one, she'd rather not die, but also she doesn't feel like she knows enough about his values to criticize them. So she finds out. Her goal is to survive long enough to escape. She starts asking about the contents of his room. Anna intuitively recognizes this undertone that Joseph has had to win everything he's ever gotten in life through blood, sweat and tears. That he lives in a world of paranoia and traps and conspiracies. He has been betrayed repeatedly. He's lost faith in others. And then she asks: “Do you have faith in me?”

Anna fully expects to have him laugh in her face. She doesn't think this drug kingpin would ever be vulnerable with anyone, especially with someone he's just met. He answers it differently than she expected: “You remind me of myself when I was six or seven. Head full of dreams and people I trusted. Never worried about being left in the cold, not by them, not by nobody. I'd burn this whole building down to live another day like that, I swear to God I would.”

Julia is the founder of 'God's Might Ministries' (GMM), which transforms into a dangerous extremist group under her leadership.
Julia embodies the traits of a charismatic and assertive leader.
Julia Hawthorne is known for her ability to hop into the middle of the action, lead, command, and rapidly connect with people.
Lust, or rather the woman called Lust, died during the Flood of Noah. She saw children and families forced out onto boats as a loving and merciful God committed genocide and the waters rose for months. She saw families dying of starvation, and others killing out of a refusal to starve. The living ate the dead.
Many have tried to tame Lust. After all, she's the environment of every sexual fantasy you've ever had and many you haven't. But Troy managed to. Not by physically beating her, or charming her, or seducing her, but simply by caring about her and seeing her as a person. Offering advice, giving support.
Lust, Envy, and Wrath would be redeemed. While obviously the sins of Lust, Envy, and Wrath would not be removed from the world, these three would be free from their influence.
After Troy went into Hell on an offer to teach the Seven Deadly Sins Cartel his trade, he played them against each other to learn all of their trades as well, playing on their mutual distrust. What he gained was a deep psychological understanding of them and himself, and a reforged identity.
Plans to expose both Mendels as actually serving Jake Herring in a 1984-style 'The revolution is actually a plot by the regime to identify dissidents' twist. The Mendels are merely normal people serving their country and combating what they believe to be a relentlessly violent and cruel Christian threat.
Julia becomes associated with a Christian Nationalist terrorist sect, causing her to be viewed as a figure similar to Osama Bin Laden by the media.
Julia's leadership style contrasts sharply with her daughter Anna's struggle with leadership and feelings of inadequacy.
Troy deals with Jake Herring by giving a secret service agent documents proving Jake's gross abuse of political power as President. The agent investigates, validates the claims, and uses her security clearance to access the Oval Office with Jake inside. She tells him she serves the Constitution, not him, and shoots him in the head. He's hospitalized, and she's long gone.
Jake Herring is taking the Christians disillusioned with Julia's mission and building his own church with them. He proclaims that he will rebuild what Julia shattered. Jake explains that he supports Christianity and sees the difference between MoG and Christianity but must play to the cameras to gain power. This is how he deceives them.
Anna's encounters with leadership have been saturated by cowardice. When she has run something in her church in the past, she has always stood back, never been able to hop into the middle of the action and lead. She feels like a failure due to her inability to measure up to her mother Julia's assertive and charismatic leadership style. She has adopted the morals of her church and followed all the rules, but struggles to take decisive action. Anna is an ISFP Enneagram 
1. Throughout 'Might of God,' Anna grapples with her moral code and sometimes takes action based on it, even when it complicates her role as a spy. Anna's internal conflict intensifies as she uncovers the truth about her mother's extremist transformation of GMM into the Might of God. 
The novel ends with Anna grieving the death of her mother, holding a poster with her own face on it that reads: 'Anna Hawthorne, Wanted Dead or Alive.'
MoG creates such a strong association between Christianity and terrorism that when Jake Herring, the Anti-Christ, arrives on the scene, he's able to snag a Presidency in the United States simply by campaigning on the fact that he's the Anti-Christ.
