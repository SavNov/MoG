The door closes behind me with a soft, deliberate click. I stand in the center of a room that looks like it was made to be admired, not lived in—expensive furniture, spotless surfaces, everything placed just so. The kind of place where nothing is out of order, and nothing is ever what it seems. It’s hard to believe for most people that this is the home of Jameson Sebastian Lockwood. One of the most ruthless and cunning businessmen in the entire state. And also, my father.

I hear his footsteps long before I see him. Steady, precise, controlled. Business. He steps into view, his face a mask of polite interest, his suit immaculate. Every detail is calculated.
He wasn’t the only one calculating.

“Troy,” he says, a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “What brings you here?”

“I need your help,” I say, cutting straight to it. I had zero interest in making this interaction last any longer than it had to.

His smile shifts, slightly wider, like he’s savoring this. “Help from me? You must be in quite a bind.”

“I need you to find someone.”

He watches me carefully, the smile never quite leaving his lips. “And why would I do that?”

“That information is irrelevant.”

He chuckles, low and smooth. “You really expect me to walk into this blind, don't you? Gone six years, and you still think I owe you something. So I'll ask again. Why the hell should I care what you want?”

“Because I'm willing to owe you a favor.” I say, cold, measured, precise, controlled, just like he was. Not on the surface, but the man beneath that.
The words tasted like poison on my lips, but I had no other place to go and no other person whom I could ask a favor from.

“Damn right you're in a bind,” he laughs.
He knows how much this is hurting me to do this. He’s enjoying it.

“Anna Hawthorne,” I say. “Sixteen.”

He nods, recognition flickering in his eyes. “Ah, yes. The zealot crowd. Interesting. And what’s so special about this one? Has she caught your eye? Has my disgrace actually found himself a young love?”

“That information is equally irrelevant,” I reply. He'd done that specifically to try and get a reaction out of me. But I'd gotten my knowledge of emotional expression from a sociopath. From him. That wasn't going to be easy to do.

“Interesting. You're learning. Now if only you'd stop hiding from me, we might be able to get some work done together,” he says, smiling.
He stops dead.
“But what makes you think I'll succeed where so many have failed?” he asks.

“Because you're Jameson Sebastian Lockwood. You don't fail.” I say, cold and direct.

He studies me, his expression unreadable, then nods. “Very well. I’ll see what I can do. But you know there’s always a price.”

“I know,” I answer.

He takes a step closer, voice dropping to a conspiratorial tone. “Whatever it is you’re up to, make sure you’re not making an enemy you can’t handle.”

“As far as I'm concerned,” I reply, meeting his gaze, “I'm already making a deal with the devil.”

His smile widens, genuinely amused now. “Touché. We’ll see, won’t we? I’ll be in touch.”
I didn't have a phone number, nor an e-mail, nor even an address, but he was my father. That had never stopped him from making his mark before.

I nod once, turning to leave. The door closes behind me, and the quiet of the house settles in again. Outside, it looks perfect, but I know better. I know every crack in the facade.
