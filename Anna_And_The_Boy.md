I found the boy sitting on the steps of an old, half-crumbling brick building. The air felt cold and bitter like it always did when you were three stories up. He couldn’t have been more than eight or nine, but he had this look, like he’d already seen too much.

I saw it in his features. He wasn't grieving, at least, not anymore. He was out here because it felt, as I knew he would probably say, nice to be above it all for a little bit, even if it was only a few minutes. Everything always seemed so small up here, even when it seemed so big in real life.

His eyes were fixed on the ground, shoulders slumped forward, like the weight of the world was pressing down on him, crushing him beneath it. The sun was dipping behind the buildings, casting long shadows across the street, but he didn’t seem to notice. He didn't seem to notice anything.

I sat down next to him, not too close—just enough to let him know I was there, but not enough to scare him off. I waited. 
*Let them initiate. They have to be the one to open up to you, not the other way around.*
He glanced at me for a second, sizing me up, and then went back to staring at the cracks in the sidewalk. Kids are good at reading people. Better than most adults.

Maybe that was why he was ignoring me now. At least, I hoped so.

“You waiting for someone?” I asked, my voice low, careful. These days, I didn’t blame anyone for being skittish around me. Hell, even I wasn’t sure what I’d do next. He didn't take off running, which was a good start.

He didn’t answer, just shook his head, his fists curling tighter in his lap. I noticed a small silver cross around his neck, the chain glinting faintly in the fading light. It dangled there, like it was supposed to protect him from something bigger than himself.
*Religious. Possibly Christian. Maybe he feels unsure of who to trust, just like me.*

I felt it, even though it was years ago. The cross sitting against my neck, the way the metal pressed against me, affirming me. *You are safe. You are secure.* How, only months ago now, Jeremy had seen it as a ward of protection. The peace and the calm in his face had been unmistakable.
“I used to have one of those,” I said, nodding toward the cross. “A long time ago.”

The boy's eyes flicked toward me, quick, cautious. He was watching me the way a cornered animal might watch a hunter. But then his gaze drifted to my hands. Something in him changed—he stiffened, like he was bracing for something bad. It would've been a strange reaction to Jeremy, but I knew better. Something like a cross meant something very different now than it had back then.

I felt it, deep in my gut, the cold realization of what was happening. It wasn’t just me. It was what I represented now. I’d been seeing it more and more lately—people didn’t look at me the same way anymore. People didn't even look at people like me the same way anymore. Even when I smiled or kept my hands relaxed, like I was harmless. They didn’t see that. They saw something else. A monster. A zealot. An extremist.

"A suspected terrorist by the-" A news reporter said below from what was no doubt a pile of TVs in the corner of an old electronics shop only to be blared into oblivion by a passing truck. But I didn't need to hear it to know what the reporter said.
*A suspected terrorist by the name of Anna Hawthorne.*

It was always the same story.
“It’s okay,” I said, trying to soften my voice more, though I wasn’t sure it would help. “You don’t need to be afraid of me. I’m not gonna hurt anyone.”

He didn’t say anything. His eyes stayed glued to my hands, and then to the cross hanging around his own neck. He wanted to believe me, wanted to believe that I was safe. But he was too scared. He couldn't bring himself to trust me. Then I saw the way he was holding the cross. He wasn't holding it because he was trying to pray to Jesus for strength or safety. He was holding it because it was familiar, like a teddy bear or something. The silence between us stretched, heavy, awkward, and I found myself reaching for something—anything—that might break it.
*His parents must be the religious ones then.*

“I’m a Christian, like they are,” I said. I thought it would reassure him. It had to, right? It would be familiar, just like the cross was, a symbol of safety. It was a statement of peace, something people used to hear and relax. "For God so loved the world-"

He cut me off so quickly even my own mouth hung open.

"No. Don't. Don't say stuff like that." He blurted.

His eyes shot up to mine, wide and full of panic. He looked at me like I’d said something terrible, something that turned the air cold between us. His lips parted, but no other words came out. The fear in his eyes was so raw, so real, that I actually felt it in my chest, like I was the one under attack.
The words went to my mind a tenth of a second after I spoke those aloud. 
*Not are. Were.*

I just stared at him, trying to process what I was seeing, what I was feeling. This boy—this kid—was afraid of me. Afraid because I told him I was a Christian. Afraid because of what people like my mother had turned that word into.

Then it hit me. Properly hit me. The only reason someone would have this kind of reactino to hearing John 3:16 was if he'd had a traumatic experience with Christians.
It hit me so hard I couldn’t breathe for a second. I wasn’t just standing there as some random woman sitting on the steps of a building. No. In his eyes, I was one of my mother's many zealot extremisms bent on killing, beating and silencing anyone seen as a threat to her vision for the world. I was the face of everything people like her had turned faith into. Fear. Control. Violence. The fact that I hadn’t done those things myself didn’t matter anymore. The name was enough. The faith was enough. The 24/7 news cycle was enough. It didn't matter that all of it was fake. People were scared, too scared to believe anything else.

“I’m not like her,” I whispered, more to myself than to him. But the words didn’t come out right. They felt hollow. False.
He'd never believe me.

I stood up, my legs shaky beneath me. The boy didn’t move—he was still sitting there, staring at me with that same terrified look, clutching the cross around his neck like it might shield him from whatever he thought I was capable of.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to tell him that I wasn’t like that. That my faith wasn’t that. But I couldn’t. Because deep down, I knew the truth. This world—this world where people like my mother were allowed to twist something so sacred into something so terrible—it didn’t care about what I wanted to believe. It didn’t care about the fact that I wasn’t her.

If this was what it meant to be a Christian now… I didn’t want any part of it.

I turned away from the boy, taking a step down the street, but I paused. The weight of his eyes on my back was too much, like his fear was branding me. I swallowed hard, letting the words tumble out, more to myself than him.

“If that’s what it means to be a Christian now,” I muttered, my voice barely a whisper, “then maybe it’s not something I want to be.”

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. I just walked away, the burn of shame and anger clawing at my chest. It wasn’t just about faith anymore. It was about her. My mother. And me. I wasn’t sure where I ended and she began. But I knew one thing for certain as I left that boy behind:

The Hawthorne in me needed to die.
