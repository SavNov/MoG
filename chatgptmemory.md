Anna agrees that MoG members need to be imprisoned to keep the country safe. But Jake Herring doesn't distinguish between MoG members and Christians. Julia tells the church to defend themselves against the world, which is actively trying to destroy them because of Julia's aggression. Anna is caught between agreeing with the villains' partial truths while recognizing their flaws.
	
Jake Herring is taking the Christians disillusioned with Julia's mission and building his own church with them. He proclaims that he will rebuild what Julia shattered. Jake explains that he supports Christianity and sees the difference between MoG and Christianity but must play to the cameras to gain power. This is how he deceives them.
	
Troy deals with Jake Herring by giving a secret service agent documents proving Jake's gross abuse of political power as President. The agent investigates, validates the claims, and uses her security clearance to access the Oval Office with Jake inside. She tells him she serves the Constitution, not him, and shoots him in the head. He's hospitalized, and she's long gone.

- Introduce her best friend Auri and their close relationship. 
2. **Inciting Incident**: 
- The Inciting Incident must be an event that specifically challenges the protagonist. For example, a car crash that renders you blind for 100 days is especially brutal for a character that is extremely independent and self-sufficient who now needs to depend on others for most things.

- Anna, now fully aware of her mother's transformation and the impact on her own life, grieves Julia's death and reflects on the consequences of their conflict.

Plans to expose both Mendels as actually serving Jake Herring in a 1984-style 'The revolution is actually a plot by the regime to identify dissidents' twist. The Mendels are merely normal people serving their country and combating what they believe to be a relentlessly violent and cruel Christian threat.
	
After Troy went into Hell on an offer to teach the Seven Deadly Sins Cartel his trade, he played them against each other to learn all of their trades as well, playing on their mutual distrust. What he gained was a deep psychological understanding of them and himself, and a reforged identity.
	
Lust, or rather the woman called Lust, died during the Flood of Noah. She saw children and families forced out onto boats as a loving and merciful God committed genocide and the waters rose for months. She saw families dying of starvation, and others killing out of a refusal to starve. The living ate the dead.
	
Many have tried to tame Lust. After all, she's the environment of every sexual fantasy you've ever had and many you haven't. But Troy managed to. Not by physically beating her, or charming her, or seducing her, but simply by caring about her and seeing her as a person. Offering advice, giving support.
	
Lust, Envy, and Wrath would be redeemed. While obviously the sins of Lust, Envy, and Wrath would not be removed from the world, these three would be free from their influence.

Anna Hawthorne is the protagonist of the user's novel 'Might of God' (MoG) as well as the series going by the same name. Anna's encounters with leadership have been saturated by cowardice. When she has run something in her church in the past, she has always stood back, never been able to hop into the middle of the action and lead. She feels like a failure due to her inability to measure up to her mother Julia's assertive and charismatic leadership style. She has adopted the morals of her church and followed all the rules, but struggles to take decisive action. Anna is an ISFP Enneagram 1. Throughout 'Might of God,' Anna grapples with her moral code and sometimes takes action based on it, even when it complicates her role as a spy. Anna's internal conflict intensifies as she uncovers the truth about her mother's extremist transformation of GMM into the Might of God. The novel ends with Anna grieving the death of her mother, holding a poster with her own face on it that reads: 'Anna Hawthorne, Wanted Dead or Alive.'
