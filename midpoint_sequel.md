What followed was an immediate 180 from her.

She paused, smiling to attempt to reassure me.

"Now where were we? Oh, yes, of course. We'll be making a few adjustments to your program, like I told you before. Nothing you need to worry about. You can just keep doing what you're doing and we'll handle everything for you." She said, back to calm and collected in a matter of seconds.

"But-" I blurted, only mere moments from the dam breaking.

I glance at Mom, expecting her to say something, to push me further, to snap me out of this fog. But she’s already moved on, already plotting. She’s talking again, her words barely making sense to me, like static buzzing in the background.

*"But what? If you have issues with this arrangement, then please, speak. We can talk this out. But if you object to the concept entirely...well...you’re not going to lead them properly, Anna, I’ll have to make some adjustments. We’ll make them into something stronger. I’ll take over—just temporarily—until you can see the bigger picture."* 

My head snaps up. *"Wait, what?"*

She’s not even looking at me. She’s pacing now, her hands gesturing as if she’s already giving commands to people who aren’t here. She’s talking fast, her words sharper, more insistent. *"You’re too focused on what’s right in front of you, Anna. This is about the future. About *our* future. God has shown me the way forward, and we need to act. You’ll thank me later."*

I blink, trying to catch up, but her words blur together, like a wave crashing over me. *Thank her?* Is she serious?

*"No, wait—"*

She stops, finally looking at me, but there’s a distance in her eyes I don’t recognize. It’s like she’s already decided what needs to happen, like I’m not even part of the equation anymore. This conversation is nothing more than a formality at this point.

*"Don't worry. You’re still learning, Anna. You’ll get there. But for now, let me take care of things."* Her voice is calm, almost patronizing. And that smile—that smile that doesn’t belong to her—flickers back into place.

A cold shiver runs down my spine.

*"What about me?"* I manage, though my voice sounds small, far away. *"I’m supposed to be in charge of this. This is *my* ministry, my—"*

*"Oh, it’s still yours, dear."* Her smile widens, but it’s empty, like she’s not really hearing me. *"I’m just stepping in to help. To make sure everything stays on course."*

It doesn’t feel like help. It feels like she’s taking over. 

Because this isn’t just about me anymore. This is about *her*. Her vision. Her path. And for the first time, I realize how small I am in her world. How little my faith—my beliefs—really matter to her.

She’s building something bigger, something *different*.

Something I don’t recognize.

*"You’ll see, Anna. God is teaching us both a lesson here. He’s shown me the way forward, and you… you’re just starting to see it."* Her voice lowers, like she’s letting me in on a secret. But it feels like she’s speaking to herself, like she’s not even aware of what she’s saying.

And for the first time, I see it. The cracks. The tiny fractures in her perfect composure. The delusions creeping in. She’s falling for her own story. She’s convinced this is all part of some divine plan. 

And that terrifies me.

And that’s the breaking point. Tears spring to my eyes before I can stop them. My throat closes up, and everything inside me starts to collapse. She’s tearing me apart, and there’s nothing I can say or do to fix this. Nothing I do is enough. I feel the words choke in my throat, but they don’t come out. Instead, I start sobbing.

"Oh, don’t cry now, Anna." She said, with a voice so delicate and precise you could do open heart surgery with it. "Everything is going to be okay. You'll keep everything of importance. This is a semantic adjustment, nothing more."

"Where's that fiery girl that told me I didn't know what I was doing? Where'd she go?" She asked playfully. "Chin up. You'll survive this. In fact, if you play your cards right, you may even thrive."

And then, something inside me snaps. It's not loud. It's not violent. But it’s there—a flicker of something sharp and cold, something that’s been buried so deep, I almost didn’t know it existed.

"What's *really* happening here?" I asked, my skepticism suddenly burning out of me.

"Excuse me?" She asks, sounding a mixture of confused and offended.

"You heard me. This isn't just some small correction, is it? This is a coup. You're going over my head to make the changes that I refuse to make, aren't you?" I asked. 

"Anna, don't get ahead of yourself. I would never. I can tell you're upset, that this ministry really matters to you. I promise you, I'm not going to get in your way. Really. You won't even notice the changes I'll make." She assured me.

I wasn't having it. 

"And if I do notice the changes you make? If I don't like them?" I asked. 

"We will cross that bridge if we come to it, and only then." She said. 

Over the months, I'd pieced together a lot on my own. A lot of the internal conflict of the church. A lot of the conflict within the underworld. At the end of the day, all I had was hunches. 

But if I was right, then I was about to know for certain.

"Like Toby did?" I asked.

"Do not drag that poor man into this conversation." She said. 

I read her face. For less than a second, though it was definitely there, I saw shock. And a bit of fear. So she *did* know something, then. Puzzle pieces began clicking together.

"Why so defensive?" I asked. 

I had been at the other end of this bag of tricks for fourteen years. I had the right to use it just once.

"I'm not defensive. I'm stunned that you would use a dead man as a token in an argument." She said, defensively.

"I'm not mad," I said softly, giving her a gentle smile. "I don't blame you for being angry either. I just want to know what happened between you and Toby."

She stiffened immediately. Troy had taught me this, but even before he'd said anything, I'd known about it. You get to tactics like these really well when they are used on you time after time after time.

*Lower the barriers to entry. Remove the guilt. Make it easier to be vulnerable.*

"Help me understand. I don't want to think that you did anything wrong, so please. What happened?" I asked softly. I frowned, looking empathetic, and held her eyes.
