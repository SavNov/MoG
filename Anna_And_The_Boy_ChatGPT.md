I found the boy sitting on the steps of an old, half-crumbling brick building. He couldn’t have been more than eight or nine, but he had this look, like he’d already seen too much. His eyes were fixed on the ground, shoulders slumped forward, like the weight of the world was pressing down on him. The sun was dipping behind the buildings, casting long shadows across the street, but he didn’t seem to notice.

I sat down next to him, not too close—just enough to let him know I was there, but not enough to scare him off. He glanced at me for a second, sizing me up, and then went back to staring at the cracks in the sidewalk. Kids are good at reading people. Better than most adults.

“You waiting for someone?” I asked, my voice low, careful. These days, I didn’t blame anyone for being skittish around me. Hell, even I wasn’t sure what I’d do next.

He didn’t answer, just shook his head, his fists curling tighter in his lap. I noticed a small silver cross around his neck, the chain glinting faintly in the fading light. It dangled there, like it was supposed to protect him from something bigger than himself.

“I used to have one of those,” I said, nodding toward the cross. “A long time ago.”

His eyes flicked toward me, quick, cautious. He was watching me the way a cornered animal might watch a hunter. But then his gaze drifted to my hands. Something in him changed—he stiffened, like he was bracing for something bad.

I felt it, deep in my gut, the cold realization of what was happening. I didn’t need to see my reflection to know what he was reacting to. It wasn’t just me. It was what I represented now. I’d been seeing it more and more lately—people didn’t look at me the same way anymore. Even when I smiled or kept my hands relaxed, like I was harmless. They didn’t see that. They saw something else.

“It’s okay,” I said, trying to soften my voice more, though I wasn’t sure it would help. “You don’t need to be afraid of me. I’m not gonna hurt anyone.”

He didn’t say anything. His eyes stayed glued to my hands, and then to the cross hanging around his own neck. The silence between us stretched, heavy, awkward, and I found myself reaching for something—anything—that might break it.

“I’m a Christian too,” I said. I thought it would reassure him. It had to, right? It was a statement of peace, something people used to hear and relax.

But his eyes shot up to mine, wide and full of panic. He looked at me like I’d said something terrible, something that turned the air cold between us. His lips parted, but no words came out. The fear in his eyes was so raw, so real, that I actually felt it in my chest, like I was the one under attack.

I just stared at him, trying to process what I was seeing, what I was feeling. This boy—this kid—was afraid of me. Afraid because I told him I was a Christian. Afraid because of what people like my mother had turned that word into.

The Hawthorne in me needed to die.

It hit me so hard I couldn’t breathe for a second. I wasn’t just standing there as some random woman sitting on the steps of a building. No. In his eyes, I was Julia Hawthorne’s daughter. I was the face of everything people like her had turned faith into. Fear. Control. Violence. The fact that I hadn’t done those things myself didn’t matter anymore. The name was enough. The faith was enough.

“I’m not like her,” I whispered, more to myself than to him. But the words didn’t come out right. They felt hollow. False.

I stood up, my legs shaky beneath me. The boy didn’t move—he was still sitting there, staring at me with that same terrified look, clutching the cross around his neck like it might shield him from whatever he thought I was capable of.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to tell him that I wasn’t like that. That my faith wasn’t that. But I couldn’t. Because deep down, I knew the truth. This world—this world where people like my mother were allowed to twist something so sacred into something so terrible—it didn’t care about what I wanted to believe. It didn’t care about the fact that I wasn’t her.

If this was what it meant to be a Christian now… I didn’t want any part of it.

I turned away from the boy, taking a step down the street, but I paused. The weight of his eyes on my back was too much, like his fear was branding me. I swallowed hard, letting the words tumble out, more to myself than him.

“If that’s what it means to be a Christian now,” I muttered, my voice barely a whisper, “then maybe it’s not something I want to be.”

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. I just walked away, the burn of shame and anger clawing at my chest. It wasn’t just about faith anymore. It was about her. My mother. And me. I wasn’t sure where I ended and she began. But I knew one thing for certain as I left that boy behind:

The Hawthorne in me needed to die.
