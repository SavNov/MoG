I sat down in the old wooden chair. Feet flat to the floor. Back straight. Boring a hole into the cold concrete with my gaze alone.
"Father...you were right about me. At the end of the day, I'm nothing. Even worse, I'm exactly like you. Games within games within games, with people like poker chips and chess pieces. I've become the man I hated." I grunted. 
I couldn't even think straight with how angry I was at myself. It scared me. I didn't know what to do. I felt paralyzed, trapped, caged, and so many other emotions that I couldn't even begin to describe.

I punched the concrete, over and over, pain shredding through the tendons in my fingers and making my blood run between them. I punched the concrete until my knuckles bled, and just kept going.

"Ten years, and you still turned out to be another dissapointment. I gave you time to prove yourself, and you certainly did."
