"I always got so annoyed with myself because no matter how hard I thought about the way I was holding them, the way I was doing the motions, how to do it all right."

I flicked the knife high into the air, watching it spin with effortless precision. My hand instinctively reached out, catching it with a fluidity that felt almost like an extension of my own body. The metal was cool and smooth against my palm, perfectly balanced.

"That's the beauty of it. You don't. You don't think about it. You let it find you."

The knife settled in my hand with a satisfying click. It wasn’t just a tool anymore—it was an extension of my own movement, flowing naturally with me. I turned it slowly, feeling the weight shift and balance as though it were part of my own rhythm.

I tossed the knife again, higher this time, and watched as it spun. My body moved to catch it, guided by instinct rather than conscious effort. The knife's arc was graceful, and when I caught it, the handle fit perfectly against my grip, like it had always belonged there.

I allowed my fingers to trace the cool edge of the blade, feeling the contours and the way it aligned with my hand. The knife’s movements were synchronized with my own, a dance of metal and skin that didn’t require thought, only presence.

In that moment, it was clear that I didn’t need to overthink every action. I didn’t need to force my way through life or try to control every detail. Just like with the knife, I could let things flow naturally. I didn’t need to be perfect or fit into a mold—just to move with what felt right.

As the knife gleamed in the light, I realized that by letting go of rigid control, I could find my own path more easily. The way the blade caught the light, the smooth glide of the handle against my fingers—it all felt right. This wasn’t about perfect execution; it was about trusting the process and allowing myself to be guided by what felt natural. Troy wasn't hard to find. I just went back to his old office, and trusted the holy powers of Ye Olde Nostalgia. When I found him, he appeared to have gone through a journey of his own. 
He was smiling. Not artificial either, he wasn't trying to charm anyone, even though he definitely could if he tried. It was that awkward smile he'd given me when we'd met for the third time, the one he'd been so quick to bury. 
(Insert detailed descriptions of his body language and facial expressions that would naturally convey the emotions that would leader her to this conclusion.)
"Somebody scared the Hell out of Julia, didn't they?" I smirked. "Good."
Yes, he'd betrayed me less than a day ago. He was also the only person I knew who was capable of pulling off what I needed.
"I apologize for my earlier behavior. The past twelve hours..." He said. 
He stared at me. I read the tiny little features in his face and painted a picture out of them. He'd gone on a journey of his own, reconnected with his emotions just like I'd connected with my identity. Ironic, really, that the one who'd criticized him so eagerly for being nothing but masks...had been wearing a few herself. But that was water under the bridge now. 
"Benefits of emotion reading." I said. 
"You can tell your life story with a glance." He finished. "Now what do you need me to do?"
"I can do the legwork, but I need a plan first, and that's up your alley, not mine." I said. 
There was no point in asking what the plan was for. There was only one thing it possibly could've been for: Take down Julia.
